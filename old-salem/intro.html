<p><b>The Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive and Transcription
Project</b> consists of an electronic collection of primary source
materials relating to the Salem witch trials of 1692 and a new
transcription of the court records.<br />
<br />
The Documentary Archive is created under the supervision of
Professor Benjamin C. Ray, University of Virginia. The
Transcription project is supervised by Professor Bernard Rosenthal,
University of Binghamton. Together with a team of scholars,
Professor Rosenthal is undertaking a new transcription of the
original court records, titled Records of<br />
the Salem Witch-Hunt, to be published by Cambridge University
Press. See <a href="transcript.html">Transcription Updates</a> for
an ongoing report of corrections to the published transcriptions,
Salem Witchcraft Papers (De Capo Press,1977).</p>
<p>For a brief description of the Salem witch trials, go to
<a href="overview.html">Overview of the Salem Witch Trials</a>.
This summary describes the main events of the witchcraft trials,
all of which are documented in the Archive's collections of primary
resources. These resources include <a href=
"texts/transcripts.html">court records</a>, <a href=
"books.html">contemporary books</a>, and <a href=
"villgchurchrcrd.html">record book</a>s, as well as images of the
original court documents, indexed according to <a href=
"archive2.html">various archival collections</a>. The overview also
refers to some of the <a href="people.html">notable people</a> who
played important roles in the trials and in the debate about the
legitimacy of the trials. Users of the Archive may <a href=
"texts/names.html">search</a> the court records and contemporary
books and letters for names of people involved, aided by a list of
notable people and by a <a href="texts/names.html">complete
alphabetical list</a> of everyone mentioned in the court
documents.</p>
<p>The Archive's historical maps of Salem Village, Salem, and
Andover show the locations of the houses of many of the people
involved in the trials. The <a href="maps.html">Regional
Accusations Map</a> displays the chronology of the accusations from
February through November 1692. and shows the spread of the
accusations across the towns of Massachusetts Bay. <a href=
"maps.html">The Salem Village Accusations Map</a> shows the
day-by-day accusations the month of March, 1692. It displays the
names of the accusers and the accused, and their household
locations, as recorded in the court documents. The Archive's
collection of <a href="lit.html">literary works</a> includes works
by <a href="texts/literary/index.html">Hawthorne</a>, <a href=
"http://aleph.lib.virginia.edu:8080/cocoon/modern-english/contents.LonCore.xml">
Longfellow</a>, <a href=
"texts/literary/index.html#whittier">Whittier</a>, and <a href=
"texts/wilkins/harp_index.html">Freeman</a>.</p>
<p>The Archive also contains educational information, such as
biographical profiles, a collection of images containing portraits
of notable people involved in the trials, pictures of important
historic sites, historical paintings and published illustrations
taken from 19th and early 20th century literary and historical
works. The Archive will also contain some of the classic scholarly
studies: <a href="scholar.html">Charles Upham's Witchcraft in Salem
Village</a>, with an interactive index, and selections from George
	Lincoln Burr's valuable <a href="http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/BurNarr.xml">Narratives of
the Witchcraft Trials.</a> Sidney Perley's History of Salem.
Finally, the archive is developing a searchable dartabase of
information about people, social groups, events, structures, and
bibliography.</p>
<p>The project draws heavily upon the manuscript and rare book
collections of several <a href="archive2.html">participating
libraries, archives, and historical societies</a>. Funding has been
provided by several <a href="projectsupport.html">foundation
grants</a>. Computing centers at the University of Virginia provide
ongoing technological support. For press coverage, see <a href=
"press.html">Press Archive.</a></p>
