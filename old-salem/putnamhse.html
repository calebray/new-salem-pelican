<td colspan="2">The Putnam House served as home to many generations
of a prominent local family. The original property consisted of 100
acres of farmland owned by Thomas Putnam in what was then Salem
Village. In 1692, Joseph Putnam lived on the property and spoke out
against the witchcraft hysteria gripping the village. In the 1850s,
Daniel Putnam operated a shoe-making shop here. A century later,
passing motorists stopped for candies and ice cream served in the
Putnam Pantry. The best-known resident of the house was General
Israel Putnam, who commanded troops at the Battle of Bunker
Hill.</td>

<td colspan="2">The Danvers Museum at the Israel Putnam House
contains exhibits on local and regional history. Then known as
Salem Village, the principal events of the witchcraft tragedy of
1692 occurred in Danvers. In the 19th century, the town became
famous for its agricultural output, including the Danvers Globe
Onion and the Danvers Half-Long Carrot. In the 21st century,
Danvers is home to manufacturers of consumer lighting products and
the world&#8217;s first mechanical heart. In addition to exhibits,
the Putnam House features a museum store. Self-guided tour maps of
historic sites in Danvers, including sites related to the
witchcraft tragedy, are available free of charge courtesy of the
Danvers Preservation Commission. The house is located directly
behind the Putnam Pantry.</td>
