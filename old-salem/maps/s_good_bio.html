  <p><b>Sarah Good</b> (no Upham map #)</p>

  <p>Born in 1653 to well-to-do innkeeper John Solart, Sarah
  Good&sup1;s life was a struggle. Her father&sup1;s estate was
  enmeshed in litigation after his death in 1672, and when finally
  settled, she was left with virtually nothing. Her first marriage
  to a poor indentured servant named Daniel Poole, ended with his
  death in 1686 and with his estate in debt. After her marriage, to
  William Good, the couple was forced to make good on her former
  husbands debts, and this left them in near poverty. Sarah was
  known to beg food and lodging in Salem Village for her family
  which in 1692 included two young children. Her sullen manner and
  mutterings at those who did not help her and her perceived curses
  upon them made her an unwelcome and suspicious neighbor.
  Following her arrest and eventual trial, Good was hanged on July
  19, 1692, but not before her "suckling child dyed in prison."
  This infant daughter has been born in December 1691. (Richard
  Trask, <i>The Devil hath Been Raised</i>, 1997, pp. 125-26.)</p>
