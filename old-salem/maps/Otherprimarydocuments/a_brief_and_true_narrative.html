    &#160;<br />
    &#160;&#160; On Thursday the Twenty fourth of march, (being in
    course the Lecture Day, at the Village,) Goodwife N. was
    brought before the Magistrates Mr. Hathorne and Mr.
    Corwin,<sup><a href="#n29">29</a></sup> about Ten of [the]
    Clock, in the Fore Noon, to be Examined in the Meeting House;
    the Reverend Mr. Hale<sup><a href="#n30">30</a></sup> begun
    with Prayer, and the Warrant being read, she was required to
    give answer, Why she aflicted those persons? she pleaded her
    owne innocency with earnestness. Thomas Putman's Wife, Abigail
    Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she
    appeared to them, and afflicted them in their fitts: but some
    of the other said, that they had seen her, but knew not that
    ever she had hurt them; amongst which was Mary Walcut, who was
    presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out of
    her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her
    wrist. It was so disposed, that I had not leisure to attend the
    whole time of Examination,<sup><a href="#n31">31</a></sup> but
    both Magistrates

    and Ministers told me, that the things alledged by the
    afflicted, and defences made by her, were much after the same
    manner, as the former was. And her Motions did produce like
    effects as to Biteing, Pinching, Bruising, Tormenting, at their
    Breasts, by her Leaning, and when, bended Back, were as if
    their Backs was broken. The afflicted persons said, the Black
    Man whispered to her in the Assembly, and therefore she could
    not hear what the Magistrates said unto her. They said also
    that she did then ride by the Meeting-house, behind the Black
    Man. Thomas Putman's wife had a grievous Fit, in the time of
    Examination, to the very great Impairing of her strength, and
    wasting of her spirits, insomuch as she could hardly move hand,
    or foot, when she was carryed out. Others also were there
    grievously afflicted, so that there was once such an hideous
    scrietch and noise, (which I heard as I walked, at a little
    distance from the Meeting house,) as did amaze me, and some
    that were within told me the whole assembly was struck with
    consternation, and they were afraid, that those that sate next
    to them, were under the influence of Witchcraft. This woman
    also was that day committed to Salem Prison. The Magistrates
    and Ministers also did informe me, that they apprehended a
    child of Sarah G.<sup><a href="#n32">32</a></sup> and Examined
    it, being between 4 and 5 years of Age, And as to matter of
    Fact, they did Unanimously affirm, that when this Child did but
    cast its eye upon the afflicted persons, they were tormented,
    and they held her Head, and yet so many as her eye could fix
    upon were afflicted. Which they did several times make careful
    observation of: the afflicted complained, they had often been
    Bitten by this child, and produced the marks of a small set of
    teeth, accordingly, this was also committed to Salem Prison;
    the child looked hail, and well as other Children. I saw it at
    Lieut. Ingersols.<sup><a href="#n33">33</a></sup> After the
    commitment of Goodw. N., Tho: Putmans wife was much better, and
    had no violent fits

    at all from that 24th of March to the 5th of April. Some others
    also said they had not seen her so frequently appear to them,
    to hurt them.<br />

    <p>[29]. Jonathan Corwin was, like Hathorne, a member of the
    Court of Assistants, the highest legislative and judicial body
    of the colony, and like him the son of one of its founders.
    They were the men of highest note in the Salem region. Corwin
    lived in the town.<br />

    <p>[31]. What drew Mr. Lawson away from the examinations was
    doubtless the need to complete his preparation for the
    important sermon of that day; and it must have been this on
    which he was pondering when (as he records a few lines later)
    the shrieks of the afflicted reached him as he walked, "a
    little distance from the meeting-house." That sermon was,
    however, no extempore production, but a studied disquisition on
    the power and malice of the Devil, who "Contracts and Indents
    with Witches and Wizzards, that they shall be the Instruments
    by whom he may more secretly Affect and Afflict the Bodies and
    Minds of others." "And the Devil," taught Lawson, committing
    himself wholly to belief in the worth of that "spectral
    evidence" which was to play such a part in the Salem episode,
    "having them in his subjection, by their Consent, he will use
    their Bodies and Minds, Shapes and Representations, to Affright
    and Afflict others at his pleasure." The magistrates were
    present at the sermon; and to them he dedicated the sermon
    when, in the following year, he gave it to the press under the
    title of <i>Christ's Fidelity the only Shield against Satan's
    Malignity</i>. A second edition was printed under his eye at
    London in 1704 (see p. 149, above).<br />

    <p>[32]. Sarah Good, who with Sarah Osburn and Parris's
    slave-woman Tituba had been examined and committed to jail on
    March 1, before Lawson's visit (see p. 343, below).<br />

    <p>[33]. Little Dorcas Good, thus sent to prison "as hale and
    well as other children," lay there seven or eight months, and
    "being chain'd in the dungeon was so hardly used and terrifyed"
    that eighteen years later her father alleged "that she hath
    ever since been very chargeable, haveing little or no reason to
    govern herself." See his petition for damages, September 13,
    1710 (printed in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</i>,
    XXXV. 253 -- the MS. is now in the President White Library at
    Cornell University). He was allowed &pound;30.<br />
