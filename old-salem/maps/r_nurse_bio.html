  <p><b>Rebecca Nurse</b> (Upham map# 95)</p>

  <p>Born in 1622 in Yarmouth, England, to William and Joanna
  Towne, Rebecca Towne married Francis Nurse about 1644. A covenant
  member of the Salem church, Rebecca attended the closer village
  meeting house. By early 1692, the nearly deaf and sickly
  matriarch of a large, gown family of eight was accused of
  practicing witchcraft. Though various friends, family, and
  neighbors petitioned and worked on her behalf, Nurse was tried in
  June. The jury at first brought in a "not guilty" verdict, but
  were instructed by the court to reconsider some points of
  evidence. Following her July 3 excommunication from the Salem
  church, she was hanged on July 19, 1692. (Richard Trask, <i>The
  Devil hath Been Raised</i>, 1997, p. 128).</p>
