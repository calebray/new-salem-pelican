  <p><b>Mary Walcott</b> (Upham map # 150)</p>

  <p>The daughter of Jonathan and Mary (Sibley), Walcott was born
  in 1675. In 1692 the 17-year-old Mary lived with her father and
  his second wife, Deliverance (Putnam), in a homestead a short
  distance northwesterly from the parsonage and near the village
  training field. Her father was a yeoman and captain of the
  village militia and her stepmother was an aunt of Ann Putnam, Jr.
  Nathaniel Ingersoll was Mary&sup1;s great uncle. (Richard Trask,
  <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997, pp. 130-131.)</p>
