  <p><b>Sarah Osburn</b> (Upham map #40)</p>

  <p>Born about 1643 in Watertown, Massachusetts, to John and
  Margaret Warren, Sarah Warren married Robert Prince in 1662.
  Robert&sup1;s sister had married Capt. John Putnam and Robert had
  been able to secure a large property in the village close to his
  Putnam in-laws. He was a supported of village independence. When
  he died in 1674, Prince&sup1;s estate was lift in trust to his
  wife Sarah with his two small sons to come into their possession
  upon maturity. Sarah purchased the indenture of an Irishman,
  Alexander Osburn, to oversee the farm, and much gossip ensured
  over their living arrangements until about 1677, when the two
  married. Osburn and his wife attempted to obtain full legal
  control over the Prince land. After her arrest an examination,
  Sarah Osburn was committed to jail, where she dies on May w10,
  1692. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997, p.
