    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;You see these accuse you, is it true</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;No.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Are you an innocent person relating to
    this Witchcraft.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Here Tho: Putmans wife cryed out, Did you
    not bring the Black man with you, did you not bid me tempt God
    &amp; dye How oft have you eat and drunk y'r own damaon What do
    you say to them</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh Lord help me, &amp; spread out her
    hands, &amp; the afflicted were greviously vexed</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Do you not see what a solemn condition
    these are in? when your hands are loose the pesons are
    afflicted.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Mary Walcot (who often heretofore
    said she had seen her, but never could say or did say that she
    either bit or pincht her, or hurt her) &amp; also Eliz: Hubbard
    under the like circumstances both openly accused her of hurting
    them</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Here are these 2 grown persons now accuse
    you, w't say you? Do not you see these afflicted persons, &amp;
    hear them accuse you.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am
    an innocent person</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;It is very awfull to all to see these
    agonies &amp; you an old Professor thus charged with
    contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it &amp; yet
    to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet
    --</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;You do not know my heart</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;You would do well if you are guilty to
    confess &amp; give Glory to God</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I am as clear as the child unborn</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;What uncertainty there may be in
    apparitions I know not, yet this with me strikes hard upon you
    that you are at this very present charged with familiar
    spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now
    they see these familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits
    com to your bodily] person, now what do you say to that</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I have none Sir:</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;If you have confess &amp; give glory to
    God I pray God clear you if you be innocent, &amp; if you are
    guilty discover you And therefore give me an upright answer:
    have you any familiarity with these spirits?</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;No, I have none but with God alone.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;How came you sick for there is an odd
    discourse of that in the mouths of many --</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I am sick at my stumach --</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Have you no wounds</p>
