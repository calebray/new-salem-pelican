Do not you  see these afflicted persons, &amp; hear them accuse you. </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an innocent person </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very awfull to all to see these agonies &amp; you an old Professor thus  charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it &amp; yet to see  you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet -- </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not know my heart </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would do well if you are guilty to confess &amp; give Glory to  God </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as clear as the child unborn </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not, yet this with me  strikes hard upon you that you are at this very present charged with familiar  spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now they see these  familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits com to your bodily] person, now  what do you say to that </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have none Sir: </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have confess &amp; give glory to God I pray God clear you if you  be innocent, &amp; if you are guilty discover you And therefore give me an  upright answer: have you any familiarity with these spirits? </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I have none but with God alone. </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How came you sick for there is an odd discourse of that in the mouths of  many -- </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sick at my stumach -- </p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you no wounds </p>  </pb>
