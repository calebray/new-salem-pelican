  <blockquote>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I have none but old age</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;You do Know whither you are guilty, &amp;
    have familiarity with the Devil, &amp; now when you are here
    present to see such a thing as these testify a black man
    whispering in your ear, &amp; birds about you what do you say
    to it</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;It is all false I am clear</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Possibly you may apprehend you are no
    witch, but have you not been led aside by temptations that
    way</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I have not</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;What a sad thing it is that a church
    member here &amp; now an other of Salem, should be thus accused
    and charged</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs Pope fell into a grevious fit, &amp;
    cryed out a sad thing sure enough: And then many more fell into
    lamentable fits.</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Tell us have not you had visible
    appearances more than what is common in nature?</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I have noe nor never had in my life</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Do you think these suffer voluntary or
    involuntary</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I cannot tell</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;That is strange every one can judge</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I must be silent</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;They accuse you of hurting them, &amp; if
    you think it is not unwillingly but by designe, you must look
    upon them as murderers</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I cannot tell what to think of it</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Afterwards when this was som what insisted
    on she said I do not think so: she did not understand aright
    what was said</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Well then give an answer now, do you think
    these suffer against their wills or not</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I do not think these suffer against their
    wills</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Why did you never visit these afflicted
    persons</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Because I was afraid I should have fits
    too</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Note Upon the motion of her body fitts
    followed upon the complainants abundantly &amp; very
    frequently</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Is it not an unaccountable case that when
    you are examined these persons are afflicted?</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I have got no body to look to but God</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Again upon stirring her hands the
    afflicted persons were seized with violent fits of torture</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Do you beleive these afflicted persons are
    bewitcht</p>

    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;I do think they are</p>
