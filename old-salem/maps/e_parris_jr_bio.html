  <p><b>Elizabeth Parris, Jr.</b> (Upham map #"149")</p>

  <p>In 1692 Betty was the middle child of Samuel and Elizabeth
  Parris between Thomas (b. 1681) and Susannah (b. 1687). She was
  born in Boston on November 28, 1682. Grievously "afflicted" early
  on, Betty was sent by late march 1692 to live in Salem at the
  Stephen Sewall house. In 1710 in Sudbury she married Benjamin
  Barron. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997,
  p. 128.)</p>
