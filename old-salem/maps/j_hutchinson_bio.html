  <p><b>John Hutchinson</b> (Upham map #77)</p>

  <p>The son of early settles Richard Hutchinson, Hutchinson was
  born in North Muskham, England, in 1633. A yeoman with a
  homestead near the village center, Hutchinson gave the
  inhabitants an acre of land in 1672 for the construction of its
  meeting house. He and his second wife Lydia Buxton, the widow of
  Joseph Small, both signed the petition in support of Rebecca
  Nurse in late 1692. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been
  Raised</i>, 1997, p. 127.)</p>
