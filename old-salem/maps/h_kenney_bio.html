  <p><b>Henry Kenney</b> (Upham map #28)</p>

  <p>Most probably Henry, Sr., he was born ca. 1624. Kenney settled
  in Salem Village about 1648 and served as a soldier in 1654 at
  the capture of St. John. He was a yeoman and died after 1705. A
  son, Henry, Jr., was born in 1669 and was living on his
  father&sup1;s homestead in 1692, a year after marrying Priscilla
  Lewis. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997,
