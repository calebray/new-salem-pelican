  <p><b>Reverend Samuel Parris</b> (Upham map # "149")</p>

  <p>Born in 1653 to the London merchant Thomas Parris, Samuel
  Parris was sent to Boston to attend Harvard College some time
  after Thomas moved to the Barbados. Upon the death of Thomas in
  1673, Samuel left the school for the West Indies to take up a
  mercantile profession on inherited land. By 1680, after finding
  little economic advantage in the Barbados, Parris returned to
  Boston, and while continuing there as a merchant for several
  years, he decided to pursue the ministry at a time when Salem
  Village was looking for a new pastor. Tenaciously attempting to
  keep his position following the 1692 witchcraft era, Parris
  finally succumbed to the pressures of his enemies and quit the
  village pulpit in 1696. Pursuing occupations of minister,
  teacher, and retailer in several different communities, Parris
  died in Sudbury in 1720. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been
  Raised</i>, 1997, p. 128.)</p>
