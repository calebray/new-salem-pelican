  <p><b>Martha Cory</b> (Upham map # 128)</p>

  <p>Probably born in the late 1620s, Martha Cory had first been
  married to a man named Rich prior to her marriage to Giles Cory.
  She was accepted into membership in the village church in April
  1690, and had a reputation of being a pious, intelligent but
  somewhat overbearing woman. After her March 1692 arrest she was
  tried in September. Following her excommunication from the
  village church on September 14 and the death of her husband on
  September 19, Martha Cory was hanged on the twenty-second of
  September. In 1703 her excommunication was revoked by the village
  church. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997,
  p. 125.)</p>
