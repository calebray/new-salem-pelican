  <p><b>Ann Putnam, Jr.</b> (Upham map #24)</p>

  <p>Born the eldest child to Ann and Thomas Putnam on October 18,
  1679, Ann, Jr., following the witchcraft era, would always be
  referred to as a sickly person. She made a public confession
  concerning her role during the witchcraft episode when in 1706
  she requested and was granted full membership into the Salem
  Village Church. She dies in 1716 never having married. (Richard
  Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been Raised</i>, 1997, p. 129.)</p>
