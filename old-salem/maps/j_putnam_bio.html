  <p><b>Joseph Putnam</b> (Upham map # 32),</p>

  <p>Following the death in 1665 of Lieutenant Thomas Putnam&sup1;s
  first wife, Ann, Thomas married widow Mary Veren. In 1669 the
  marriage produced one child, Joseph, who was half-brother to
  Thomas Sr.&sup1;s other children, including Edward and Thomas,
  Jr. There was much animosity when, upon the father&sup1;s death,
  it became evident that Joseph and the second Mrs. Putnam, no the
  elder brothers, had inherited the best part of this valuable
  Salem Village estate. Though the older brothers attempted to
  contest the will, Joseph, upon his eighteenth birthday, became
  one of the richest villagers. In 1690 Joseph married Elizabeth,
  daughter of Israel Porter, and in October 1691 he was elected to
  the Village Committee. Joseph Putnam&sup1;s mother-in-law was the
  sister of Magistrate John Hathorne, and it might have been
  through that connection that he was asked to record the March 1
  testimony. Thereafter, however, Joseph was a well-known opponent
  of the witchcraft proceedings and is traditionally supposed to
  have kept horses ready to flee if he himself were accused. Joseph
  was the father of the Revolutionary War folk hero Israel Putnam.
  Joseph died in 1725. (Richard Trask, <i>The Devil Hath Been
  Raised</i>, 1997, p. 130.)</p>
