					<p>The GIS of "Salem Village in 1692" is part of an electronic Research Archive
						of primary source materials related to the Salem witch trials of 1692. The
						purpose of the GIS is twofold: </p>
					<p>First, the GIS gives visual representation of the social context of the witch
						trials episode by placing the nearly 300 people mentioned in the court
						records in their actual household locations in the Village. When completed,
						the database will hold the location of over 150 family households in Salem
						and surrounding communities. The documents also refer to conflicts between
						neighbors in the Village and to kinship ties among various families in the
						Village. </p>
					<p>Such relationships are more easily grasped when the locations of the family
						members and households are displayed on a map. Important property disputes
						stand in the background of the Village's experience, among families later
						caught up in the witchcraft trials, and the map shows the disputed property
						boundries. Since the beginning of historical studies in the 19th century,
						scholars have used maps has the foundation of their interpretations of the
						causes of the conflict. This GIS will enable new forms of mapping to further
						study of the conflicts in Salem.</p>
					<p>Second, the GIS is also able to represent in graphic form important
						demographic information, such as age, gender, frequency of accusations by
						various individuals, family relationships, relative wealth of accusers and
						accused -- all of which have played an important role in scholars'
						interpretations. </p>
