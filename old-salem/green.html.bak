            <p> Whereas there are many Persons ye dwell among us and belong to ye Congregation who

                examination they be found neither fundamentally ignorant nor erronious. </p>
            <p> 2. That timely notice being given to the Congregation (of ye desires of such persons
                to be baptized) there be no sufficient evidences appear to testify ye they are
                vicious in their lives. </p>

                and to be happy in the enjoyment of him forever. </p>
            <p> You do also acknowledge ye Lord Jesus Christ the Eternal son of God to be your only
                Saviour and Redeemer; and (under a sense of yr sin and misery &amp; need of him) do
                give up yrself to him to be saved by him from sin and from the wrath of God. </p>
            <p> You do also acknowledge the Eternal Spirit of God to be your only Sanctifyer, and do
                give up yrself to him to be sanctifyed, comforted, and guided by him to Glory. </p>

            <p> 4. We do also consent yt the children of such persons be baptized provided the
                parents publickly give ym up to God, and promise yt if God shall spare their lives
                they will see such their children educated in the nurture and admonition of ye Lord. </p>
            <p> This was voted by itself -- and there was none that manifested any dis. Satisfaction

                carryed by Mr. Noyes (who prayed) &amp; Mr Pierpoint preachd, &amp; concluded. "The
                reasons for the Thanksgiving were, 1. Yt God has so far discovered ye wiles of ye
                Devil which might have been more hurtfull and distructive to us, if God had not in
                judgmt remembred mercy. 2. Yt when ye people were farthest from peace &amp; unity yt
                God was pleased to hear prayers &amp; unite us, &amp; especially to hearken to those
                prayers yt were put up here on a day of publick fasting &amp; prayer by Mr. Hale
                &amp; Mr. Noyes, from wee day God was pleased to succeed all publick endeavours for
                a peaceable settlemt. 3. &amp; yt God has now for some years continued peace and
                prosperity to us. 4. that he has been carrying on his work in ye midst of us,
                &amp;c." </p>

                land being sensible of ye errors yt prevailed in yt day -- some of her friends have
                moved me several times to propose to ye Chh whether it be not our duty to recall yt
                sentence yt so it may not stand agt her to all Generations and I myself being a
                stranger to her &amp; being ignorant of what was alledg'd ag her -- I shall now only
                leave it to your consideration, and shall determine the matter by a vote ye next

            <p> The confession of Anne Putnam when she was received to communion: 1706. </p>
            <p> I desire to be humbled before God for yt sad and humbling providence that befell my
                fathers family in the year about 92, yt I then being in my childhood should by such
                a providence of God be made an instrument for yt accuseing of severall persons of a
                grievous crime wherby their lives were taken away from them, whom now I have just
                grounds and good reason to believe they were innocent persons, and yt it was a great
                delusion of Satan yt deceived me in that sad time, whereby I justly fear I have been
                instrumental with others tho' ignorantly and unwittingly to bring upon myself &amp;
                this land the guilt of innocent blood Though what was said or done by me against any
                person I can truly and uprightly say before God &amp; man I did it not out of any
                anger, malice, or illwill to any person for I had no such thing against one of them;
                but what I did was ignorantly being deluded by Satan. And particularly as I was a
                chief instrument of accuseing of Goodwife Nurse and her two sisters I desire to lye
                in the dust &amp; to be humbled for it in that I was a cause with others of so sad a
                calamity to them &amp; their familys, for which cause I desire to lye in ye dust
                &amp; earnestly begg fforgiveness of God &amp; from all those unto whom have given
                just cause of sorrow &amp; offence, whose relations were taken away or accused. </p>

            <p> The major part of the brethren consented to ye following &amp; </p>
            <p> Whereas this Church passed a vote Sept. 11. 1692 for the excommunication of Martha
                Cory, and that sentence was pronounced agt her Sept. 14 by Mr. Samll Parris formerly
                the Pastour of this Church; she being before her excomn condemned &amp; afterwards
                executed for supposed witchcraft: and there being a record of this in our Chh book
                page 12. We being moved hereunto do freely consent &amp; heartily desire that the
                same sentence may be revoked, and that it may stand no longer agt her for we are
                thro' Gods mercy to us convinced yt we were at that dark day under the Power of
                those errours which then prevailed in the land ; and we are sensible that we had not
                sufficient grounds to think her guilty of that crime for which she was condemned
                &amp; executed; and yt her excom -- was not according to the mind of God; and
                therefore we desire that this may be entred in our Church book, to take off that
                odium that is cast on her name and that so God may forgive our sin, &amp; may be
                atoned for the land, &amp; we humbly pray that God will not leave us any more to
                such errours and sins, but will teach &amp; enable us always to do that which is
                right in his sight. </p>
