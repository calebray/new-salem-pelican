<p>Thomas Brattle, born in 1658, was "an opulent and cultivated
Boston merchant" and a generous Harvard alumnus. Made treasurer in
1693, a post that he held for twenty years, the college grew in
fiscal strength. Brattle was also a noted amateur astronomer and
mathematician, and a member of the Royal Society. In 1699,
following the principles of religious toleration established by the
new royal charter, he quietly organized the Brattle Street Church,
which tended toward the teachings of the Church of England instead
of staunchly Puritan doctrine.<br />
<br />
Brattle's significance to the Salem witchcraft outbreak stems
mainly from his authorship on October 8, 1692 of a widely read
<i><a href=
	"http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/BurNarr.xml">
Letter</a></i> sent to an unknown "clerical correspondent," which
denounced the foundations on which the accusations, arrests,
trials, and executions were conducted in Salem. It was sent only
five days after the circulation of Increase Mather's book <i>Cases
of Conscience</i> that denied the theological validity of spectral
evidence. Brattle, a liberal in both politics and religion,
provided a secularized perspective on the trials. According to
Perry Miller, Brattle's letter was "the first treatment of the
disaster that step[ped] outside the scheme of the jeremiad" (<i>New
England Mind</i>). Due to the "highly literate and satirical tone"
of Brattle's <i>Letter</i>, Perry Miller refers to it as "a
milestone in American literature." While Brattle makes very clear
his complete agreement with Mather's <i>Cases</i>, a comparison of
the tone and focus of these two works is exemplary of the
developing departure from Puritanism then underway in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony.<br />
<br />
In his <i>Letter</i> Brattle focuses most of his account on the
method of the madness. He describes to his English correspondent
the nature of the accusations, examinations, and trials, and he
brings to the attention of the "Salem Gentlemen" some of the public
criticism against the trials. First, the method of proving guilt by
requiring the accused to relieve the suffering of the afflicted in
court by a touch of the hand was of special concern to Brattle. "I
cannot but condemn this method of the Justices, of making this
touch of the hand a rule to discover witchcraft; because I am fully
persuaded that it is sorcery, and a superstitious method, and that
which we have no rule for, either from reason or religion." Here,
the place of reason before religion was more than a stylistic
device, but a method of analysis. Brattle further writes that this
kind of "sorcery" and "superstition" is not fit to be named a new
philosophy "in a land of such light as New England" and that "the
reasonable part of the world, when acquainted herewith, will laugh
at the demonstration, and conclude that the said [Salem Gentlemen]
are actually possessed, at least with ignorance and folly."<br />
<br />
Second, Brattle turns his attention to the nature and validity of
confessing witches. In a methodical argument, Brattle finds that
these confessors are "unfit to be evidence either against
themselves, or any one else" and that they "do very often
contradict themselves, as inconsistently as is usual for any
crazed, distempered person to do." Hoping that the people of the
colony will join him in rationally appreciating the desperate
situation the confessed "witches" are in, Brattle argues that "his
neighbors" will "be soon convinced that there is nothing at all in
these arguings, if they would but duly consider of the
premises."<br />
<br />
Finally, he looks at the indictments and trials themselves. He
assails the use of spectral evidence by the Magistrates and Jury,
but does so on legal rather than theological grounds. He finds that
despite the denials made by the Salem supporters of the trials,
spectral evidence is the basis on which innocent people are
convicted. Therefore, Brattle writes that the most recently
executed "went out of this world not only with as great
protestations, but also with as good shews of innocency, as men
could do."</p>
<p>After excoriating the substance and basis of the trials, Brattle
continued to denounce a number of associated practices. He noted
the ability of some accused to escape arrest and persecution by
virtue of their high social position or family relationships. Many
were allowed to escape while others were hounded into the jails.
Additionally, Brattle attacked the practice of recruiting the
advice of the afflicted girls in rooting out witchcraft, pointing
specifically to the circumstances in Andover that does "now rue the
day that ever the afflicted [girls from Salem Village] went among
them". However, Brattle aimed his most scathing criticism at the
effect of this hysteria on the liberties and freedoms enjoyed among
men in the colony. "Liberty was evermore accounted the great
privilege of an Englishman; but certainly if the devil will be
heard against us, and his testimony taken to the seizing and
apprehending of us, our liberty vanishes, and we are fools if we
boast of our liberty."<br />
<br />
Brattle concludes his account with what Perry Miller regards as
"one of the greatest sentences of the time, which, eschewing the
jargon of the covenant, reveals how much the theme of the jeremiads
had become, if only through the discipline of disillusion, a
secular patriotism." Brattle states, "I am afraid that ages will
not wear off that reproach and those stains which these things
leave behind them upon our land." The focus here on the effects the
episode will have on "our land" was significant for a Puritan world
accustomed to viewing itself as the domain of God.<br />
<br />
Thomas Brattle's <i>Letter</i> pried opened a chink in the armor of
the Puritan jeremiad and the logic of the covenant by the use of
reason to combat hysteria. Miller writes that "[b]y strictly and
conscientiously applying the doctrine of the jeremiad, the court
created a situation in which meretricious confession went free and
sincere denial automatically became guilt." Whereas the Puritan
covenant with God placed high value upon confession and repentance
as a cure for social ills, these became evasive maneuvers which
"did not heal the grievance, but compounded the evil."<br />
<br />
While Thomas Brattle's <i>vision</i> <a href=
	"http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/BurNarr.xml">
Letter of October 8, 1692</a> did not contribute to ending the
Salem witchcraft hysteria, it provides a brilliant example of a
growing sentiment in late-17th Century New England that the
strictures of the jeremiad and framework of the covenant may not be
the omnipotent force which many a Puritan minister admonished his
flock from the pulpits of Boston. The <i>Letter</i> shows, instead,
how the extreme events that occurred in Salem revealed clearly to
some the extremism and danger inherent in the reigning theology of
the day.</p>
