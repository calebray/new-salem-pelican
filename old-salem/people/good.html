<p>Sarah Good was born in 1653 to a well off innkeeper named John
Solart. However, her father's estate was tied up in litigation that
left Good virtually nothing. Her first marriage was to a poor
indentured servant named Daniel Poole who died in debt in 1686. Her
second marriage to William Good was doomed from the outset because
the couple had to pay for the debts of first husband Poole. The
Goods were homeless, renting rooms in other people's houses, and
they had two young children. William worked as a laborer around
Salem Village in exchange for food and lodging, but it became
increasingly difficult for the family to find a place to stay as
Sarah's reputation for and being socially unpleasant spread
throughout the town. The family was regarded as a nuisance to the
town, and by 1692 they were virtually beggars.</p>
<p>Good's position as a disreputable and marginal member of society
made her a perfect candidate for witchcraft accusations. On
February 29, 1692, the first warrant was issued for the arrest of
Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. The three were accused
initially of afflicting Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, and
later many other accusers came forward to testify about injurious
actions and spectral evidence against Good. Good was the first to
testify in the Salem Witchcraft trials, and Bernard Rosenthal in
<i>Salem Story</i> asserts that Good was specifically chosen to
start the trials off because most people were in support of ridding
Salem Village of her presence. Even her six-year-old daughter
Dorcas was frightened into testifying against her, and although her
husband did not call her a witch, he said that he, too, had reason
to believe she was close to becoming one, thus, perhaps, protecting
himself from accusation. One of Good's trial records quotes William
Good as saying, "it was her bad carriage to [me] and indeed say I
with tears that she is enemy to all good." Despite the overwhelming
sentiment against her, Good adamantly denied Magistrate John
Hathorne's accusations. When Hathorne in the pre-trial hearings
asked, "Why do you hurt these children?" Good responded, "I do not
hurt them. I scorn it." She also stated repeatedly, "I am falsely
accused."</p>
<p>Although Good never confessed, she did accuse Sarah Osborne of
afflicting the girls after witnessing the accusers fall down in
fits in the courtroom. Historians generally agree that this
accusation by Good was one of the first and strongest
legitimizations of the witchcraft trials. Only one person came
forth to defend Good. When one of the girls accused Good of
stabbing her with a knife and produced a broken knife tip to prove
it, a man came forward showing that it was his knife from which the
tip had been broken in the presence of the accusing girl. Far from
invalidating the girl's testimony against Good, Judge Stoughton
simply asked the girl to continue with her accusations with a
reminder to stick to the facts.</p>
<p>Good was condemned to hang but was pardoned until the birth of
her child. Her daughter Dorcas was accused of witchery and was
imprisoned for over seven months. Although the child of six years
was eventually released on bond, she was psychologically damaged
for the rest of her life. Good's infant died in prison with her
before Good was hanged. Her execution occurred on Tuesday July 19,
1692. According to local tradition, when Good stood at the gallows
prepared to die she was asked once more by Rev. Nicholas Noyes,
assistant minister in the Salem church, to confess and thus save
her immortal soul. Far from confessing, Good is said to have
screamed, "You're a liar! I'm no more a witch than you are a
wizard! If you take my life away, God will give you blood to
drink!" It was this constant refusal to confess that Bernard
Rosenthal believes led Good to the Gallows, even more so than all
of the accusations against her.</p>
<p>The way in which Good has been portrayed in literature is worth
mentioning because it sheds light upon how the Salem Witch Trials
have been popularly imagined and how the accused witches were and
are viewed today. Good is always depicted as an old hag with white
hair and wrinkled skin. She is often said to be sixty or seventy
years of age by the same writers who clearly state that she was
pregnant and had a six-year-old daughter. Even accounts from Salem
Villagers and magistrates at the time refer to her as an old
nuisance, hag, and bed-ridden. How did such a misconception arise?
Perhaps her hard life did have such a physical effect on Good that
she did appear extremely aged. On the other hand, witches are
described in literature then and now as being old wicked women. If
Good was to represent the typical witch worthy of execution, then
it is not surprising that all of the stereotypes would be
accordingly attached. Good was a marginal woman and no doubt a
nuisance to her neighbors. However, the Salem trials were conducted
unfairly, with a presumption of guilt, and little evidence.
Marginality is not worthy of hanging, and Good was never proved to
be nor did she confess to be a witch.</p>
