<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Born in England about 1611, Giles Corey was one of the six men
to be executed during the Salem witch trials of 1692. John Proctor,
George Burroughs, George Jacobs Sr., John Willard, and Samuel
Wardwell were all hanged after being convicted of witchcraft, while
Giles Corey was pressed to death with stones for refusing to "put
himself on the country," that is, to allow himself to be put on
trial. He emigrated from England to Salem and remained there until
1659 when he relocated to Salem Farms, just south of Salem Village.
There he owned an extensive plot of land, which resulted in the
appearance of his being a prosperous farmer. His personality,
reputation and relationships with others however tainted that
picture. Although he had become a full member of the Village church
and had close ties with the Porter faction in the Village, his
reputation as one who lacked consideration for others in the
community and as one who lead a "scandalous life," quite possibly
had a significant impact on his being accused as a witch. Because
of Corey's previous encounters with the law, there was further
suspicion of his guilt during the witch trials. In 1675, Corey
pummeled and killed a farm worker named Jacob Goodale. He was found
guilty of the murder and ordered to pay a substantial fine.</p>
<p>By the time of the trials, Giles Corey was already 80, and was
married to Martha, his third wife. On March 19, 1692, Martha was
arrested for witchcraft. Giles, for reasons unknown to others,
decided to testify against his wife, but eventually tried to recant
his deposition, which lead to greater suspicion of his involvement
in witchcraft because of the stigma surrounding perjury. One month
later, on April 19, 1692, Giles Corey was accused of witchcraft and
there was a warrant out for his arrest. There were two primary
accusations, one from Abigail Hobbs who during her own confession
to witchcraft named Giles and Martha Corey as fellow witches, and
one from Exekiell Chevers and John Putnam, Jr., who filed an
accusation on behalf of Ann Putnam, Marcy Lewis, Abigail Williams,
Mary Walcott and Elizabeth Hubbard.</p>
<p>After his arrest, Giles Corey remained in jail with his wife
until his trial on September 16, 1692. He went to the trial and
pleaded "not guilty" but simultaneously refused to "put himself on
the court" because of his contempt for the court. Corey was not
willing to submit himself to a trial by jury that, he believed, had
already determined his guilt. Because the court had accepted the
testimony of the same accusers in a trial on September 9, and in
all previous trials, Giles understood that there was no chance of
being found not guilty and that a conviction would be inevitable.
In every previous trial when an accused individual had plead not
guilty, not a single person was cleared so Giles preferred to
undergo "what Death they would put him to" rather than be found
guilty of witchcraft and thus put to death. According to English
law, Giles was ruled as "standing mute" because he would not be
tried by "God and my country." The Court of Oyer and Terminer
strictly adhered to the requirement that a defendant "put himself
on the country". Because Giles stood mute, he was given the dreaded
sentence of <i>peine forte et dure</i> even though this procedure
had been determined to be illegal by the government of
Massachusetts. It was illegal for two reasons: there was no law
permitting pressing, and it violated the Puritan provisions of the
Body of Liberties regarding the end of barbarous punishment. In the
entire history of the United States, Giles Corey is the only person
ever to be pressed to death by order of a court.</p>
<p>There is a strong local tradition Giles Corey refused trial in
order to avoid a conviction that would result in the forfeiture of
his property to the government. Under English and Massachusetts
law, however, conviction could not result in the forfeiture of an
estate. However, the George Corwin, the Sheriff of Essex Country
illegally seized the property of some of those arrested for
witchcraft. Before his arrest, Corey himself was clearly concerned
about his extensive estate, and he wrote a will that deeded his
land to his sons-in-law William Cleeves and John Moulton. The laws
clearly stated that landowners retained the right to give their
land to their heirs rather than forfeit it because of a conviction,
and apparently Corey knew it. Thus it does not seem likely that
Corey refused to go on trial to save his property.</p>
<p>On or before September 18, 1692, Giles Corey was slowly pressed
to death in the field next to the jail. In the literature about
Giles Corey's tortuous death, there is reference to his famous last
words, "more weight." These words were uttered as a final attempt
to expedite his death while also showing that not even imminent
death could convince him to go to trial. It is even told that the
Sheriff took his cane and pressed Giles' tongue back into his mouth
just before he died at the end of the two days of being slowly
crushed. On September 18, 1692, Giles Corey was ex-communicated
from the Village church so that he would not die as a member of the
church. On September 21, 1692, Martha, his wife, was hanged on
Gallows Hill. It has been speculated that the publicity surrounding
the pressing of Giles may have in fact helped to build public
opposition to the witchcraft trials.</p>
<p>In Arthur Miller's, <i>The Crucible</i>, Giles Corey is a
prominent character in part because of his unique role in the witch
trials. Giles' colorful past, his willingness to be tortured before
compromising his own values, and his role in his wife's conviction
are the factors which make him such a vibrant character. Although
Millers' presentation of Giles Corey in <i>The Crucible</i>is not
purely historical, his place in the witch trials will never be
forgotten. Giles Corey did in fact testify against his wife in
front of the court, and he seems to have stood mute as an act of
dramatic defiance. Henry W. Longfellow's <i>Giles Corey of Salem
Farms</i> is another piece of literature that portrays Giles Corey
in a strong and powerful manner. In his play, Corey's character is
defined by his last conversation with his friend Capt. Richard
Gardner. In the play, Giles Corey says: "I will not plead. If I
deny, I am condemned already, in courts where ghosts appear as
witnesses, and swear men's lives away. If I confess, then I confess
to a lie, to buy a life which is not a life, but only death in
life. I will not bear false witness against any, Not even against
myself, whom I count least...I come! Here is my body; ye may
torture it, but the immortal soul ye cannot crush!"</p>
<p>This passage shows why the character of Giles Corey attracts
attention not only when examining court documents from 1692 but
also the present day literature. Giles Corey will be remembered
unambiguously in literature and history because of his act of
supreme defiance to the Salem witch trials.</p>
