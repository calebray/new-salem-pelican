						<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br/> An Undergraduate
								Course, University of Virginia<font size="+1"><br/></font> Spring
								Semester 2001</b></p>
						<p>In evaluating those Puritan ministers involved in the Salem witch trials,
							we would certainly have to regard the Rev. Samuel Willard of Boston as
							one of the virtuous clergymen, as he was opposed to the trials and tried
							to influence public opinion against them in 1692. Undoubtedly, great
							things had long been expected of Willard, as his family lineage bespeaks
							that of a man destined to make an impact upon the community.</p>
						<p>Willard was born in the town Concord, Massachusetts Bay in 1640. His
							place among the town's leaders was virtually assured from birth, as his
							father, Simon Willard, was the founder of Concord. Willard soon set out
							on the familiar course for young aspiring ministers, enrolling at
							Harvard where he would study long enough to receive his Master's Degree
							in 1659. Indeed, Samuel Willard could very well be remembered solely for
							his fiery devotion to the Puritan church, as he was well known for his
							vicious denunciations of any attempts to water down the Puritan tenets
							of predestination, irresistible grace, total depravity, and perseverance
							of the saints. Willard was also known for his staunch support for the
							continued marriage between church and state, and held strong opposition
							to the creeping Quaker and Baptist influences in the community. In these
							ways, Willard's sermons were heavily influential to men who would take
							up the Puritan cause after his death, Jonathan Edwards in particular.
							Nevertheless, it is Willard's role in the witch trials that concerns us
							here.</p>
						<p>Willard's past experience seems to make him a fine candidate to speak out
							about the trials of the 1690s, as he played a crucial role in heading
							off a potential outbreak of hysteria some twenty years prior to the
							Salem episode. In 1671, while ministering in the frontier town of
							Groton, Massachusetts Bay, Willard was witness to a number of strange
							acts that befell one of his servants, a young girl of sixteen by the
							name of Elizabeth Knapp. Knapp seems to have exhibited a number of the
							symptoms that would be made famous by the "afflicted" girls of Salem
							village twenty years later. Indeed, Knapp was observed to act in a
							"strange and unwonten" manner, and often fell into violent fits and
							complained of being attacked. When Knapp eventually accused the specter
							of a neighbor of attacking her, Willard insisted she put an end to such
							accusations at once, for the neighbor was a person of "sincere
							uprightness before God." Also, Willard seems to have exercised good
							judgment in being hesitant to believe that the devil afflicted the girl,
							writing that "Whither shee has covenanted with the Devill or noe, I
							think this is a case unanswerable, her declarations have been soe
							contradictorye. . . . ". Although Willard was yet to denounce the idea
							of Satan using a person's image or specter to attack another person,
							here he seems to have used impeccable judgment in not rushing to
							conclusions about why his young woman appeared afflicted.</p>
						<p>Willard's role in Salem also presents a man concerned that innocent
							people must be protected from the misinformed and vicious elements in
							the Puritan society. When Governor William Phips sought guidance from
							some of the learned clergy in the area, Willard was one of the several
							who signed "The Return of Several Ministers." This document acknowledged
							that while the devil might be responsible for the afflictions found in
							Salem, it urged the court to exercise great caution to prevent the
							innocent from being convicted. The ministers further discounted the
							reliability of spectral evidence by asserting that the devil could
							impersonate the likeness of any person, even an "innocent" without that
							person's permission. Although the court in Salem ignored this caution,
							spectral evidence was eventually called into question the trials lost
							their theological foundation. The work of Willard and his like minded
							colleagues also shows that to whatever extent clergymen in Salem may
							have contributed to the witchcraft outbreak, Willard and other Boston
							ministers tried to quell its spread.</p>
						<p>A level-headed moderate concerning witchcraft, Willard is thought to have
							written a sixteen page fictional dialogue between two ministers who hold
							opposed points of view on the Salem trials. One minister represented the
							views of the Salem clergy, the other represented the Boston ministers.
							The dialogue, entitled "Some Miscellany Observations on our present
							debates respecting Witchcrafts: A Dialogue between 'S' and 'B'" is
							clearly the work of one who saw great injustice in the theological and
							legal aspects of the trials. Among Willard's chief complaints is the
							fact that so often a confession coupled with further accusations
							resulted in an acquittal, while a denial of guilt virtually guaranteed
							one's conviction. Among the Boston minister's key arguments in the
							dialogue is that "witches" who ultimately confess and accuse other
							witches are not to be trusted, because, after all, they're witches! When
							the Salem clergyman decries using too much caution, allowing many
							witches to go free, Boston replies that "the more horrid the crime is,
							the more cautious we ought to be in making any guilty of it." Boston's
							point being that relying on the suspect spectral evidence was no basis
							from which to ruin men and women's lives and cast a permanent stigma
							upon their family name.</p>
						<p>Samuel Willard continued to be a tireless anti-trial activist well after
							the trials had passed. In 1694, he pushed for a reconciliation between
							the pro and anti-Samuel Parris factions within Salem village. Willard
							was also known to ask, in public ceremony and sermon, for God to forgive
							the atrocities that had taken place in Salem at the hands of overzealous
							townsfolk.</p>
