<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<font size=
"+1"><br /></font> Spring Semester 2001<br />
<br /></b> Although described as a "generous, compassionate. . .
man of conscience," the late-seventeenth-century New England
Puritan Samuel Sewall sat on the court of judges who condemned
nineteen innocent men and women to be hanged as witches during the
Salem witchcraft trials of 1692. Both Sewall's private diary and
the books he published during his lifetime depict his agony over
the decisions and his lingering personal distress. Fearful of God's
judgment upon himself and his family, he eventually proclaimed his
humiliation to God and the Colony in a confession of guilt read
before the congregation of South Church in Boston.<br />
<br />
Born in England in 1652, Sewall immigrated to Newberry,
Massachusetts in 1667. At the age of fifteen, he began theological
studies at Harvard to obtain a Bachelors degree and he then
continued to achieve a Masters degree. The pursuit of a Masters
degree for most people meant a calling to the ministry. However,
instead of preaching, in 1675 Sewall married Hannah Hull, the
daughter of John Hull, a wealthy mint master in Boston,
Massachusetts. With this marriage, Sewall inherited business
responsibilities, and thus he began the life, which he would
continue until his death, as a merchant in Boston. The choice of
ministry or merchandise troubled Sewall, but in reality, his
decision to become an active apprentice with Hull was inevitable.
During this time period, gradually power was moving away from the
pulpit and into the hands of the wealthy: the merchants.</p>
<p>With wealth and power came the opportunity, or rather
commitment, to public service. Sewall did not shy away from these
duties, but rather embraced them. In 1677 he became of member of
the South Church in Boston which enabled him to become a freeman of
the colony in 1678. In 1684, Sewall was elected to the Court of
Assistants (the legislative body of the Massachusetts Bay Colony),
and in May of 1692, Governor Sir William Phips appointed Sewall as
a commissioner (judge) in the Oyer and Terminer Court, a court
established to bring to trial those accused of witchcraft.
Eventually Sewall would culminate his public life with a seat on
the governor's council and an appointment as a justice for the
Superior Court of Massachusetts in 1698.</p>
<p>During this era, the colony relied mostly on Biblical authority;
thus a judge needed to be instructed in the word of God over that
of common law. Hence when Governor Phips appointed he judges for
the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Sewall was an ideal choice. He had
a strong theological background and the contemporary belief in the
devil and witches. As the trials progressed during 1692, Sewall
joined with the other judges (Richards, Gedney, Winthrop, Sargent,
Corwin, Stoughton) and condemned nineteen people to death. Yet, an
unanswered question remains. Did Sewall feel remorse at the time
for these decisions, or did he truly believe that he was acting
correctly and in line with Puritan and biblical values? The answer
remains unknown since Sewall's diary entries during the trials
primarily tell the facts, if even any of those, rather than his
thoughts and opinions.</p>
<p>Yet, Sewall's thoughts after the trials are known because of
both his diary and public voice. During the five years following
the trials, two daughters, Jane and Sarah, died, as did his beloved
mother-in-law. In combination with a stillborn child and the public
humiliation he sustained from the trials, Sewall experienced
constant distress. He truly believed that the witchcraft
accusations and trials "the wrath of God visited upon him" as he
was a sinner and had not repented (Lovejoy, 358). At this same
time, New Englanders recognized the need for reckoning with God.
Thus, on January 14, 1697, all parties, including ministers and
government officials, agreed to a colony-wide "Day of Prayer and
Fasting." On this famous day, the Reverend Willard read to his
Boston congregation a confession of guilt written by Sewall
himself:</p>
<p>"...as to the Guilt contracted, upon the opening of the late
Commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for
this Day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned that
any that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and Shame of it,
Asking pardon of Men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who
has an Unlimited Authority, would pardon that Sin and all other his
Sins; personal and Relative: And according to his infinite
Benignity, and Sovereignty, Not Visit the Sin of him, or of any
other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land. . . "</p>
<p>In his own words, Sewall begged God for forgiveness and asked
that that God "cease visiting his sins upon him, his family, and
upon the land" (Lovejoy, 360).</p>
<p>Sewall confessed because he believed he had made a "grave error
in condemning those tried in the Salem proceedings" and that his
belief in the covenant with God would save him (Graham, 45). In the
covenant, one enters into a bond with God, he sins, is afflicted,
repents, is forgiven, and enters back into the covenant (Miller,
197). Sewall recognized his sins in condemning innocent people to
the gallows. Part of the community's hope with the "Day of Pray and
Fasting" was that others, too, would recognize their sins
throughout the trials and then repent for their actions. If the
whole community asked for forgiveness, perhaps God would shed peace
on the fragmented community that had faced crop failure, losses at
sea, epidemics, Indian raids, and the threat of the French. In the
end, no other judge offered a confession, but the Salem jurors and
several ministers did so throughout the year.</p>
<p>Although Samuel Sewall's name rarely appears in the actual court
documents, he was a prominent figure in the Salem witchcraft
trials. Not only do Sewall's diary entries recount the events and
provide vital information for scholars studying the trials, but his
confession plays a significant role since it is one few. He alone
stood before society and proclaimed that society had done wrong. He
took responsibility for his actions and thus his outstanding moral
character does not diminish because of his mistakes during
1692.</p>
