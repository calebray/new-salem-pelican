<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Born in Watertown, Massachusetts in about 1643, Sarah Warren
married Robert Prince, a Salem Villager who purchased a 150-acre
farm next to Captain John Putnam's. Putnam was Prince's neighbor
and also his brother-in-law and the executor (along with Thomas
Putnam) of his will. When Prince died prematurely in 1674, he left
his land entrusted to his wife Sarah with the provision that upon
their coming of age, it be given to his and Sarah's two sons --
James, who was six-years-old at the time, and Joseph, who was two.
However, soon after her husband's death, Sarah hired an indentured
Irish immigrant by the name of Alexander Osborne as a farm hand and
paid off his indenture. Rumors spread about Sarah and Alexander's
living together and eventually the two were married. Sarah, then
attempted to overtake her children's inheritance and seize control
of the estate for herself and her new husband, thus breaking her
deceased husband's will. Legal battles ensued between Osborne and
her children, who were the rightful heirs of Prince's land and were
defended by the Putnams. Such conflict continued until February of
1692 when Sarah Osborne became one of the first three persons
accused of witchcraft in Salem.</p>
<p>Sarah was accused by Thomas and Edward Putnam, Joseph
Hutchinson, and Thomas Preston for afflicting Ann Putnam, Jr.,
Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and Elizabeth Hubbard. Unlike the
other two women accused with her, Tituba and Sarah Good, Osborne
never confessed to witchcraft nor attempted to accuse anyone else.
In her own defense, she was the first defendant to assert in her
defense the theological claim that the devil could take the shape
of another person without their compliance -- a view that
eventually prevailed and brought the Salem trials to a halt.
Nonetheless, Osborne never came to trial because she died, shackled
in prison on May 10, 1692 at the age of 49.</p>
<p>Why was Sarah Osborne accused of witchcraft? To answer this
question, we must look closely at the society in which she lived
and at her reputation in it. Historians Paul Boyer and Stephen
Nissenbaum argue that many of the accused witches were perceived as
upsetting established "patterns of land tenure and inheritance."
Sarah Osborne fits this profile. Not only was Salem Village aware
of her fornication with Alexander (an obvious Puritan sin), but by
endeavoring to gain full ownership of her late husband's estate,
she disregarded her society's set practices of inheritance and land
tenure, and challenged the tradition of strong, extended family
alliances. By aspiring to deny her two sons of their wealth and
social position, she threatened the growth and stability of Putnam
family alliances in Salem Village.</p>
<p>Is a woman who betrays her society's social and family
conventions worthy of an accusation of witchcraft? Not in today's
society, but in seventeenth century New England these offenses were
socially and economically serious, and a threat to the divinely
sanctioned social order. Specifically, the Putnam family's economic
interests and inheritance grew less secure by Sarah's attempt at
social and economic independence. Consequently, but not
surprisingly, it was members of the Putnam family who accused
Osborne.</p>
<p>While such theories may offer explanations as to why Sarah
Osborne, as opposed to her husband Alexander, was accused of
witchcraft, we might also ask why she was actually convicted. If
only 19 of the approximately 160 people accused were actually
executed, what prevented Sarah Osborne from surviving? Unlike
Tituba and Sarah Good who both confessed to witchcraft and falsely
accused Osborne, Osborne did not confess nor did she accuse anyone
else, and hence unknowingly at this stage, she closed an
opportunity that might have saved her. Even though it later became
apparent that the way to survive an accusation was to confess and
to point fingers at others, Sarah Osborne repeatedly affirmed her
innocence. When asked by local officials why she practiced with the
devil, Osborne responded with bewilderment that she "was more like
to be bewitched than that she was a witch." Ultimately, it was her
refusal to compromise her integrity that cost Sarah Osborne her
life.</p>
