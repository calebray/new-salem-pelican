<p>The story of the Rev. George Burroughs is important because of
its differences from the other accusations. Burroughs was one of
the few men executed during the trails, and he was the only
clergyman accused of witchcraft. He has often been portrayed in
popular accounts of the trials, because some of his accusers
claimed him to be the "ring leader" of the witches and because of
the especially dramatic nature of his execution in the presence of
the Rev. Cotton Mather.<br />
<br />
George Burroughs was born to a rather well to do family in Suffolk,
England in about 1652. At a young age he left England for
Massachusetts By Colony and was raised by his mother in the town of
Roxbury. He later attended Harvard College and graduated in 1670.
After graduating, he moved to Maine and started preaching in
Falmouth (Portland, Maine) until the town was attacked by Indians
in 1676 forcing him to leave. He was a minister in Salisbury for a
few years and eventually in 1680 was called to Salem Village to be
the new minister.<br />
<br />
The issues leading up to his accusation as a witch are rooted in
the events that happened in his two-year stay in Salem Village. One
of the major complaints seems to have been Burroughs'
unconventional religious beliefs. In the book <i>Salem Story</i>,
Bernard Rosenthal, stresses the significance of the fact that the
Rev. Increase Mather and his son Cotton Mather, both prominent
ministers in Boston, did not agree with Burroughs' religious
convictions. Rosenthal suggests Cotton Mather may have suspected
him of being a Baptist. When on trial questions put forward to
Burroughs dealt with his religious practices, especially the
baptism of his children and his lack of attendance at the Lord's
Supper, in an attempt to expose his deviance from Puritan
doctrines.<br />
<br />
Burroughs, as minister of the Salem Town in 1680-1683, also became
involved in village quarrels. In once instance, Thomas Putnam lent
Burroughs some money, and when he was unable to pay the money back,
the town reacted strongly and he was pushed out of Salem. In 1683
he returned to Maine.<br />
<br />
On April 30, 1692, Burroughs, together with several others, was
accused of witchcraft. The original document stating the charges
was signed by Thomas Putnam and Jonathan Walcott. Burroughs was
charged with "high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft done or
committed by then upon the bodies of Mary Walcot Marcy Lewis
Abigail Williams Ann Putnam and Eliz. Hubbard and Susan Sheldon."
On May 4, 1692, he was forcefully taken from his home in Wells,
Maine, to Salem, and put in jail.<br />
<br />
One man fueling the attacks on Burroughs was Cotton Mather. Cotton
Mather was at this time known for his cautionary writings on how
spectral evidence in the trials should be used. However, as
Rosenthal suggests, in Burroughs' case Mather put aside his views
on the unreliability of spectral evidence, further suggesting that
Mather's hatred of Burroughs was based on Burroughs' role as a
religious dissident.<br />
<br />
For this reason, Burroughs can be viewed as the one person executed
for witchcraft for his religious beliefs. As Puritan dissenter
Burroughs was attacked by the Puritans and seen as harmful to their
society. The first question asked of Burroughs at his trail was
whether his children were all baptized. He said only one of them
was. On August 3, 1692, many testified against Burroughs. Young
girls such as Elizabeth Hubbard, Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon,
Mary Walcott and Ann Putnam all claimed that he had come to them
and tried to force them to sign his book which Elizabeth said was
written in words "as red as blood". Mercy Lewis claimed that
Burroughs "carried me up to an exceeding high mountain and shewed
me all the kingdoms of the earth and told me that he would give
them all to me if I would writ in his book"(Salem Witchcraft
Papers). Accused witches such as Abigail Hobbs and Mary Warren
charged him with bringing them into the world of Satan. He was the
"ring leader of them all" holding the meetings in Salem and trying
to force many away from God and to Satan.<br />
<br />
Another factor working against Burroughs was the fact that his
first two wives had died. Ann Putnam claimed that the two wives
came to her as visions and told her that Burroughs had killed them
and that he was indeed working for the Devil. John and Rebecca
Putnam claimed he was "sharp with his wife".<br />
<br />
Burroughs was also known for his superhuman strength. Men at the
trial testified that they had seen him "put his fingers into the
Bung Barrall and lifted it up, and carried it round him and set it
downe again"(SWP). Others claimed that he was able to lift up a
six-foot gun using one hand with no difficulty. His brut strength
was more proof of his allegiance with the devil.<br />
<br />
All this testimony lead the court to conclude that Burroughs was
indeed a sorcerer and was in fact the leader of the witchcraft
related events. As Boyer and Nissenbaum seem to suggest, Burroughs
was in a way used as a scapegoat. By attributing to him the role of
the ringleader, the witchcraft problem was no longer associated
with the community of Salem Village but was put upon the shoulders
of one man, George Burroughs.<br />
<br />
From the actual documents, one can conclude that Burroughs was a
man with powerful enemies in Salem Village. The fact that he was a
minister did little to soften the accusations against him. The
other key player was Cotton Mather. Rosenthal's theory that
Burroughs was a religious dissenter is highly plausible. Mather was
after Burroughs because he believed him to be a Baptist as well as
a witch.<br />
<br />
Burroughs' trial was the only one attended by Increase Mather.
Mather believed that if someone could perfectly recite the Lord's
Prayer then he or she was not a witch. However, as Robert Calef
writes in his book <i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i> "Mr.
Burroughs was carried, through the streets of Salem to Execution;
when he was upon the Ladder, he made a Speech for the clearing of
his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious Expressions, as were to
the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by
repeating the Lord's Prayer) was so well worded, and uttered with
such composedness, and such (at least seeming) fervency of Spirit,
as was very affecting, and drew Tears from many ( so that is seemed
to some that the Spectators would hinder the Execution)".<br />
<br />
NathanielHawthorne describes this scene in his powerful story
<i>Main Street</i> and refers to Burroughs as going to a "martyr's
death". Hawthorne depicts Burroughs as an innocent victim of the
terrible trials. He writes "Who would not say, while we see him
offering comfort to the weak and aged partners of his horrible
crime, - while we hear his ejaculations of prayer, that seem to
bubble up out of the depths of his heart, and fly heavenward,
unawares, - while we behold a radiance brightening on his features
as from the other world, which is but a few steps off, - who would
not say, that over the dusty track of the Mainstreet, a Christian
saint in now going to a martyr's death?" When the crowed calls for
the execution to be stopped Hawthorne continues "Ah no; for listen
to the wise Cotton Mather, who. As he sits there on his horse,
speaks comfortable to the perplexed multitude , and tells them that
all had been religiously and justly done, and that Satan's power
shall this day receive its death-blow in New England". Calef
recorded that, "Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse,
addressed himself to the People, partly to declare, that he [George
Burroughs] was no ordained minister, and partly to possess the
People of his guilt; saying, That the Devil has often been
transformed into an Angel of Light." In doing this he reassured the
crowd of Burroughs' guilt and the execution proceeded.<br />
