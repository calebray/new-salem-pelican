<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>Elizabeth (Betty) Parris was nine years old when the witchcraft
epidemic broke out in Salem, and she actively participated in its
beginning. Elizabeth, a sweet girl, had difficulty facing the stark
realities of predestination and damnation that her father, Reverend
Samuel Parris, preached to her. Elizabeth Parris lived in a period
of economic uncertainty and yearned to know what lay in her
future.</p>
<p>In the dark winter days of 1691, Elizabeth Parris and her cousin
Abigail Williams began to undertake experiments in fortune telling,
using a device known as a "venus glass." A venus glass consists of
an egg white suspended in water in which one could see shapes and
figures. The girls mainly focused on their future social status,
and specifically on the trade in which their husbands would be
employed. These fortune telling secrets were shared with other
young girls in the area. On one occasion, the glass revealed the
horrendous specter of a coffin, which, as Rev. John Hale reported
in <i>A Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft</i>, (1702)
led to "diabolical molestation.". And it is out of these childish
beginnings that the Salem witchcraft outbreak began.</p>
<p>Betty Parris' afflictions started innocently in January when she
began to forget errands, was unable to concentrate, and seemed rapt
in secret preoccupation. She could not concentrate at prayer time
and barked like a dog when her father would rebuke her. She
screamed wildly when she heard the "Our Father" prayer and once
hurled a Bible across the room. After these episodes, she sobbed
distractedly and spoke of being damned. She seemed to see damnation
as inevitable, perhaps because of her practicing fortune telling,
which was regarded as a demonic activity.. Reverend Samuel Parris
believed that prayer could cure her odd behavior, but his efforts
were ineffective.</p>
<p>Nobody knows precisely what the Betty Parris and her girls
friends were experiencing, but it manifested itself as odd
postures, foolish and ridiculous speech, distempers, and fits. John
Hale in <i>A Modest Inquiry</i> described the affliction that the
girls suffered by saying they looked as if they "were bitten and
pinched by invisible agents; their arms, necks, and backs turned
this way and that way, and returned back again, so as it was
impossible for them to do of themselves, and beyond the power of
Epileptick fits, or natural disease to effect. Sometimes they were
taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their throats choked, their limbs
wracked and tormented so as might move a heart of stone to
sympathize with them." The local physician, William Griggs,
diagnosed Elizabeth Parris as being afflicted by the "Evil Hand,"
commonly known as witchcraft. Rev. Samuel Parris thought it was "a
very sore rebuke and humbling providence that the Lord ordered the
horrid calamity to break out first in [his] family." Since the
sufferers of witchcraft were believed to be the victims of a crime,
the community set out to find the perpetrators.</p>
<p>On February 29, 1692, under intense adult questioning, the
afflicted girls named Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba as
their tormentors. Elizabeth Parris testified at these trials that
she was tormented by spectral visions of these women. During their
trials, Elizabeth would cry out when the accused moved her arms,
legs, or head, as if the accused was injuring her from across the
room. Elizabeth Parris was also involved in the conviction of
Martha Corey. At Martha Corey's trial, the afflicted girls sat
together, and what Martha did, they all did. If she shifted her
feet they did so too, and fell to stamping their feet. If she bit
her lips, they yelled that she had bitten theirs, and showed the
magistrates tht they bled." .</p>
<p>Understandably, Mrs. Parris was worried about the health of her
daughter and she protested against using her as a witch finder. At
the end of March, Betty was sent to live with Rev. Samuel Parris'
distant cousin, Stephen Sewall, in Salem. This technique of
isolation stopped most of her symptoms, but she still had visions
after leaving the Parris household. On March 25, Elizabeth "related
that the great Black Man came to her, and told her, if she would be
ruled by him, she should have whatsoever she desired, and go to a
Golden City" (Lawson). Mrs. Sewall told Elizabeth that it had been
the Devil who had approached her "and he was a Lyar from the
Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he came again: which she
did" (Lawson).</p>
<p>In 1710, Elizabeth Parris finally found the answer to the
question she had been searching for in her homemade crystal ball.
She married Benjamin Baron, a yeoman, trader, cordwainer, and
shoemaker, in Sudbury and led a very ordinary existence. She and
Benjamin bore four children, Thomas, Elizabeth Jr., Catherine, and
Susanna. Elizabeth Parris survived her husband by six years,
succumbing to illness in their Concord home on March 21, 1760
(Marilyn Roach).</p>
