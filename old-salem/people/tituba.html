<td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and
Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b><br />
<br />
In late February of 1692, Reverend Samuel Parris called in a doctor
to examine his nine-year-old daughter, Betty, and eleven-year-old
niece, Abigail Williams-both of whom were suffering from
spontaneous fits. The children were soon diagnosed as victims of
witchcraft, setting off an outbreak of panic and hysteria, which
would sweep throughout Salem Village and its neighboring towns that
year. Historians have long pointed the collective finger of blame
at the Parris's slave, Tituba, one of the three women first accused
of witchcraft, and the only member of this unfortunate trio to
survive the year.<br />
<br />
Many interpretations of the Salem Trials acknowledge the pivotal
role Tituba's confession played in legitimizing the early
suspicions and subsequent investigations of witchcraft, seizing on
the vivid descriptions of the devil and his minions that she
provided to the examining justices. A number of sources also assert
that Tituba also introduced supernatural ideas to the "afflicted
girls." These scholars claim Reverend Parris had purchased her in
Barbados, unaware of the voodoo and witchcraft practices she would
eventually undertake under the roof of the Salem parsonage.<br />
<br />
However, the mantle of guilt so eagerly thrust upon Tituba may not
be rightfully hers (and at the very least, not hers alone). Later
investigations have only raised more questions about the very
little verifiable information available on her. Most of the
perceptions and understandings of Tituba, today commonly accepted
as fact, are actually based on local tradition and fictional
literature rather than actual court documents or eye-witness
accounts. Admittedly, the legend of Tituba as the "Black Witch of
Salem" (a posthumous appellation which immediately suggests
interesting racial and class connotations) may be more mysterious
and entertaining than the accurate historical extent of her
influence on the Salem trials; nevertheless, the ways in which this
myth has been constructed are fascinating as well.<br />
<br />
In all of the court documents relating to the Witchcraft Trials,
Tituba's identity is listed as that of an "Indian Woman, servant"
(for example, Warrant vs. Tituba and Sarah Osborne -SWP 745). But
as scholars have recently pointed out, somewhere in the development
of the Salem lore, Tituba's racial heritage has been transformed
and confused-thus she appears in texts variously as "Negro,"
"half-breed," "colored," or "half-Indian, half-Negro." Assumptions
about her origins range from the island of Barbados to Africa to
Native American. This confusion necessarily complicates any
understanding of the consequential and critical part traditionally
assigned to Tituba; we must consider how racial stereotypes and
presumptions have contributed to the varying amounts of blame she
is forced to bear.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, Tituba's story may never be clearly sorted out. Her
status as a slave constrains any attempts to uncover official
records and papers relating to her. The little glimpse of her life
that is available is provided only by the court transcripts
themselves. Though Tituba's words may resonate to us through the
court records, she cannot tell her version of the events leading up
to the Trials, she cannot share her own history and memory of Salem
and life before it. In addition to Tituba's own recorded words, we
can obtain some information based on what her contemporaries said
of her. Beyond these strict limitations however, we can
realistically draw no further conclusions as to her racial
identity, affinity for witchcraft and stories of the occult, nor
motivations for confessing to the accusations.<br />
<br />
What we do know is from the historical documents is that Tituba was
in fact a slave in the Parris home at the time of Betty and
Abigail's initial sufferings. Tradition holds that she was married
to another slave, John Indian, and the couple was purchased by
Reverend Parris during time he spent in Barbados. Tradition,
however, does not a history make. Tituba and John Indian did reside
with the Parrises; Samuel Parris had a plantation in Barbados, and
he owned two slaves after he returned to Boston, and she could have
come from Barbados. However, the story that Tituba struck the
"fatal spark" and ignited simmering tensions in Salem Village by
enthralling the local teenage girls with her stories of African or
Caribbean voodoo and magic spells must be recognized for what it is
--a story. It was not her "voodoo spells and stories" which, in
fact, caused the girls' initial hysterics but their practice of
forbidden fortune telling.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in the court records or contemporary accounts is Tituba
said to have taught the practice of fortune telling to the girls in
Rev Parris' house. The fortune telling technique that the girls'
used, as reported by one of them to the Rev. John Hale, was an egg
white in a glass of water. This was a commonly known device in New
England at the time, and it was condemned by the Puritans as a
demonic practice. According to the Rev. Hale, one of the girls saw
a "specter in the likeness of a coffin" in the glass, and she and
another girl fell into fits. Tituba did not confess to the teaching
of fortune telling; she confessed to signing the Devil's book,
flying in the air upon a pole, seeing a cats wolves, birds, and
dogs, and pinching or choking some of the "afflicted" girls. She
also said she was beaten by her owner, Rev. Parris, and was told to
confess to witchcraft, which she did -- and what she confessed to
was all culturally European, not African or Caribbean.<br />
<br />
Tituba's confession, however, did ignite a "spark" in the court,
especially when she named the other accused witches, Good and
Osborne, as her accomplices. Confession is what the judges were
looking for, and Tituba's "evidence" of a conspiracy of witches in
Salem Village stimulated the court and the girls to find and
convict more people.<br /></td>
