<p>Philip English is an interesting figure in the Salem witch
trials because his prominence in the community raises questions
about the pattern of accusations; his escape from jail and the
gallows provides insight about the politics behind the trials; and
his post-trials experience highlights how the Colony attempted to
rectify the fiscal wrongs committed against the victims of the
trials.<br />
<br />
A warrant was issued for English's arrest on April 30 1692, but he
was nowhere to be found, and another warrant had to be issued on
May 6. His wife, Mary, had been taken into custody one week
earlier. Facing indictments from Mercy Lewis, Susannah Sheldon and
William Beale, in late May, Philip finally surfaced from hiding and
joined his wife in John Arnold's jail in Boston, perhaps because
his avoidance of the law was hurting their legal situation. Philip
and Mary stayed in Boston for nine weeks under lenient supervision
until the eve of their expected return to their August trial in
Salem. But instead of returning, the couple escaped to New York
where they stayed throughout the duration of the trials. Men of
prominence including Rev. Joshua Moody of Boston, Governor Phips of
Massachusetts and Governor Fletcher of New York apparently aided
the Englishs' escape into safe hands. New York was a predominantly
Dutch settlement, and it was known for its religious tolerance and
disapproval of the proceedings in Salem.<br />
<br />
After Governor Phips officially ended the trials in May 1693,
Philip English returned to Salem with his wife in good spirits. But
he soon became disheartened by the pillaging of his wealthy estate
at the hands of Sheriff Corwin and the death of his wife Mary by
consumption during childbirth a year later. English fought through
several petitions for restitution of his estate (which in 1692
included 14 buildings, 21 sail vessels, a wharf, and a warehouse).
He estimated damages of 1,183 pounds of which he was only awarded
60 during his lifetime and another 200 at his death. The legality
of such land and estate seizures is complex, but it remains that
several authorities including Phips, English's ally, knew that
Essex County Sheriff George Corwin was not forwarding the money to
the colony or the Crown as he claimed. This brief sketch of Philip
English's involvement in the trial raises many questions - one of
course being the reason he was accused - especially considering the
fact that he was allowed to disappear.<br />
<br />
The biography of Philip English, born Philippe d'Anglois in 1651,
begins hazily as historians have had little luck discerning his
past before he came to Salem in 1670. Of French Huguenot descent,
he immigrated from the Isle of Jersey into the mercantile class of
Salem town. From this point, historians have had little trouble
keeping track of him because quickly upon his arrival, he
established himself as a successful trading merchant. His success
increased when he married Mary, the only daughter of William
Hollingsworth, the head of a prominent shipping legacy and
longstanding family in Salem and Massachusetts. This brief
introduction sets up several characteristics that have been argued
as the root of English's involvement with the witch trials: 1)
English was an immigrant 2) with Protestant tendencies who 3) was
successful in the changing economy of Massachusetts. In sum,
English was an outsider to the community. Despite his involvement
within the community on economic, political and social realms, he
existed as an outside threat to the harmony of the Salem
community.<br />
<br />
First, he was French, and a Huguenot at that. Bryan F. Le Beau's
essay, "Philip English and the witchcraft hysteria," emphasizes
English's non-Puritan religious background even though he and Mary
attended services and baptized their children at Salem's First
Church. His wife was even admitted into full communion in 1681.
Many legends report English to have been hostile towards the
Puritan faith, but conflict did not arise until long after the
trials in 1714 when he gave money to help erect an Anglican church
in a nearby town. At this point tension arose as English refused to
pay his church taxes and as Le Beau's essay cites, he spoke out
feverishly against Rev Noyes, one of the Puritans ministers during
the trials, as having "murdered" John Proctor and Rebecca Nurse.
Although English later rebels against the Puritan religion, there
is no documented basis to believe that he his religion was an
outright problem with the Puritans at the time of the accusations.
Nonetheless, his French Protestant descent made him different and
consequently vulnerable.<br />
<br />
English's personal character probably caused more discontent than
his Anglicanism. Having many land parcels in various locations made
him liable to frequent episodes of litigation. The lawsuit brought
against him by William Beale involved a heated debate about the
boundaries of a piece of land in Marblehead. English's open
hostility against Beale would come back to haunt him when Beale
accused English's specter of witchcraft two years later during the
trials. English's consistent land disputes when coupled with the
town's prejudice against the superior style in which his family
lived exposed English to a volatile hostility.<br />
<br />
The rich lifestyle of the English's may caused resentment among
Salem villagers, but more accurately, the fact that an Anglican
immigrant merchant could find such spectacular financial success in
Salem was especially disturbing. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum
in <i>Salem Possessed,</i> "if one had to choose the single person
most representative of the economic and social transformations
which were overtaking Salem - and Massachusetts as a whole - in the
late seventeenth century, Philip English might as well be that
person." Boyer and Nissenbaum that claim factions had arisen
between Salem Village and Salem based on economic and political
relationship. English was incredibly successful in the young
mercantile industry rather than in farming, and was thus
representative of the new economy that many farmers perceived as a
political threat to the Villagers' desire for independence from
Salem and its accompanying social style. Infuriating the farmers,
perhaps, merchants in Salem were taking prominence in local
politics. Philip English had been appointed as a town's selectman
in March of 1692 - one month before he was accused of
witchcraft.<br />
<br />
Indeed, English fits into Boyer and Nissenbaum's analysis of the
witch trials as an outgrowth of pre-existing tensions along
economic and political lines, but more broadly, English became a
representative of all that Salem Villagers distrusted: he lived a
lavish lifestyle, he was Anglican, he was an immigrant, he
sympathized with other French Huguenot immigrants, and he was
becoming politically active. English would not be able to escape
the accusation, but he was able to escape the gallows. Historians
do know that higher political authorities such as Governor Phips
was an ally of English in his escape and in the restitution of his
estate, so perhaps his powerful allies made it futile to go after
English. Since I believe English was targeted as a threat to the
agrarian community, perhaps the stripping of his lucrative estate
and his complete absence from the town were sufficient to satisfy
the accusers' goals.</p>
