Bridget Bishop has developed into a colorful character in the
legendary history of Salem Village. As the first woman tried and
executed as a witch during the Salem witchcraft trials, she has
attracted a lot of imaginative speculation about her character and
behavior.<br />
<br />
The Bridget Bishop that is most commonly portrayed is one who kept
a house of refreshment for travelers, and a shuffle board for the
entertainment of her guests. She generally seemed to have exhibited
certain behaviors and appearances that exposed her to some scandal.
She wore a showy costume for the austere Puritan times -- a red
bodice. Her freedom from the severity of Puritan manners and
disregard of conventional decorum in her conversation and conduct
brought her into disrepute, so the tongue of gossip was generally
loosened against her. She is portrayed as a folk heroine in Salem's
story. A spirited, feisty, buxom, and lusty woman who flaunted
Puritan morals with a happy public house where drinking and
gambling occurred. Many say that it was her flashy taste in dress,
her smooth and flattering manner with men, and the questionable
gaieties that had gone on in her two taverns, which led to people
gossiping about her as a witch as far back as King Philips
War.<br />
<br />
This, however, is not the same Bridget Bishop of history. Research
done by historian David Green indicates that scholars and writers
have confused Bridget Bishop of Salem with Sarah Bishop, a tavern
keeper in Salem Village. Bridget Bishop lived on a small piece of
property in Salem Town and was between fifty-five and sixty-five in
1692, when she was accused of witchcraft. The account below follows
the more historically accurate description of Bridget Bishop's
life, taken from Bernard Rosenthal's book Salem Story.<br />
<br />
In 1666, the widow Bridget Wasselbe married Thomas Oliver and had a
daughter named Christian. This marriage was less than idyllic. In
1678, Bridget was accused of calling her husband names on the
Sabbath, and both she and her husband were sentenced to stand
gagged in the market place for their offenses. In January 1679,
Bridget and Thomas were both sentenced to be whipped for fighting.
It was not unusual for Bridget's face to be battered during her
marriage to Thomas Oliver. In 1680, she was accused of witchcraft.
This accusation could have been facilitated by Thomas' claim that
"she was a bad wife . . .the devil had come bodily to her . . . and
she sat up all night with the devil." (Charles Upham, Salem
Witchcraft). This accusation occurred after her husband died
without leaving a will, and seems to be the classic case of a
vulnerable, propertied woman being accused of witchcraft. She
posted bond, and there is no record of any punishment. In 1687, she
was charged with stealing brass objects. Her record then remains
clean until she is brought up on witchcraft charges again in April
1692.<br />
<br />
On April 19, 1692 at her examination, Bridget Bishop began her
testimony with courtesy and deference. This deferential attitude
soon gave way to anger as she realized that denying her involvement
was not an effective strategy. The afflicted girls were in the
courtroom swooning in response to the imagined spectral advances of
Bridget Bishop. Magistrate John Hawthorne unleashed his loaded
questions, asking, "How is it that your specter hurts those in this
room?" Bridget replied, "I am innocent to a witch. I know not what
a witch is." Hawthorne turned this answer to his advantage by
asking, "How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what
a witch is." She replied, "I am clear: if I were any such person
you should know it." Although it is not clear what Bridget meant by
this comment, Hawthorne clearly took it as a veiled threat and
replied, "You may threaten, but you may do no more than you are
permitted" (Salem Witchcraft papers). No one can know for certain
if this bold interchange earned Bridget Bishop the distinction of
being the first hanged on the gallows.<br />
<br />
On May 27, Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer
to try those accused of witchcraft. On June 2, Bridget Bishop was
the first person tried in the new court, perhaps because her
previous witchcraft accusation made her a likely candidate. In her
trial, spectral evidence was given an unprecedented status. She was
charged with "tortur[ing], afflict[ing], pin[ing], consum[ing],
wast[ing]: &amp; torment[ing] her victims," Abigail Williams, Ann
Putnam Jr., Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, and Elizabeth Hubbard.
Bridget vehemently denied the charges at her trial, believing that
to be the only way to avoid execution. She did not realize that her
only hope lay in confessing to witchcraft. When Cotton Mather wrote
of the evidence against her in his book Wonders of the Invisible
World, he included preposterous stories that could best be called
gossip. One such story recounts that Bishop cast a glance upon
Salem meeting house, while walking under guard. This "look" caused
a board, which had been fastened with nails, to be removed to
another portion of the house. Her case served as a model for future
cases to come, following a very predictable pattern. The
"afflicted" persons made their accusations, which were denied by
the accused; members of the community told of past acts of
witchcraft by the accused; and one or more confessors validated the
claim of the accusers. The court used spectral evidence as the
primary legal basis to convict Bridget Bishop. Hanged on June 10,
her death warrant emphasizes only the harm done to her accusers,
primarily on the day of her examination, as the legal justification
for the execution.<br />
<br />
"On June 10, 1692, High Sheriff George Corwin took [Bridget Bishop]
to the top of Gallows Hill and hanged her alone from the branches
of a great oak tree. Now the honest men of Salem could sleep in
peace, sure that the Shape of Bridget would trouble them no more"
(Upham). Bridget Bishop was the first person to be hanged as a
result of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials.</td>
