<p>Ann Dolliver was the daughter of Rev. John Higginson of Salem
Town and was unhappily married to Willliam Dolliver of Gloucester.
Court records of 1683 show that complaints were made against
William Dolliver for being idle and neglecting his family. In fact,
he left the Massachusetts Bay Colony, abandoning Ann and her
children with no means of support. Ann was forced to leave
Gloucester with her children to return to her father's home in
Salem where he and the town supported them. She retained her title
of respect (Mrs.), but her social standing was compromised and her
mental state soon declined.<br />
<br />
Before June 1692 her situation was already on shaky grounds. But on
June 6, when she was about 45 years old, she was arrested for
"Witchcraft on the Bodys of Mary Warren and Susannah Sheldon." Only
the warrant for Dolliver's arrest, the testimony of Elizabeth
Nicholson against Dolliver, and the newly discovered pre-trial
examination are known to scholars today. During her examination,
Warren and Sheldon were present along with Mary Walcott. The
examination was conducted on June 6 before Magistgrates Gedney,
Hawthorne, and Corwin. Ann Dolliver's specter was portrayed as a
particularly nasty one. The accusers reported that Dolliver's
specter wanted to kill her own father out of spite. They also said
that the specter of a dead child blamed Ann Dolliver for its
murder. When the judges asked Ann if she possessed wax puppets, an
indication of magic that the Puritans regarded as witchcraft, she
replied that she did fourteen years ago, but only "because she
thought she was bewitched and she read in a book: that told her;
that that: was [the] way to afflict: them [that] had afflicted
her." In other words, Ann Dolliver pleaded self-defense. When
answering the question, "Mrs Dolliver did you never act
witchcraft," she defended herself and implicitly confessed at the
same time: "not with the intent to hurt anybody with it." She
admitted to having done witchcraft in 1678 to protect herself and
her family, but denied that she afflicted her accusers in 1692.
Lack of further documentation makes determinations difficult, but
it appears that Dolliver was released due to insufficient evidence
or because of her questionable mental condition.<br />
<br />
Her life did not improve after the trials ended. In a letter to her
brother written in August 1693 (which, strangely, did not mention
the witch trials), her father, Rev. Higginson, described her as
suffering from "overbaring malloncolly, crazed in her
understanding." As of 1705, she had been declared to be mentally
incompetent (<i>non compos mentis</i>) and remained a dependent of
her father.<br />
<br />
Scholars do not address Ann Dolliver's case as often as others in
the trials. Carol Karlsen's feminist study, however, examines her
case. According to her analysis, which is based on gender roles in
Puritan society, Ann Dolliver fits a socio-economic profile. While
her father was prominent and wealthy, she was a deserted wife and
was utterly dependent on her father. Caught between being single
and being a widow, her situation was precarious. As such, Dolliver
was practically impoverished at the time of her accusation. Her
condition made her vulnerable to attack because, as a poor woman,
the officials would be less likely to overlook charges launched
against her. Also, she did not have a husband to deflect the
charges. Basically, she was a poor and therefore vulnerable woman.
Marshall Swan continues in this vein when he observes that mentally
unstable women were often vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft
at this time.<br />
<br />
Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissembaum have a different place for Ann
Dolliver. While she is not explicitly treated in their study, she
cleanly fits their paradigm. They argue that the trials were based
on the Village's anxieties. The more rural Salem Village was
engaged in a struggle to obtain its independence from the
prosperous seaport, Salem Town. Loyalty to the Town church or
connections to the emerging capitalism in the Town represented
opposition to this cause. Boyer and Nissenbaum find that the
majority of accusers were connected to the Village and that the
majority of the accused associated with the Town. Ann Dolliver fits
into this scheme because her father was a minister in Salem Town.
Her father had also defended one of the accused witches, sarah
Buckley, thus contradicting the girls' testimony. Ann Dolliver may
therefore hve been targeted as a way of hitting back at her father.
Her strong connections to the Town made her an adequate scapegoat
for what her father represented.</p>
