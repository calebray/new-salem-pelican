Samuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to Thomas Wardwell and
Elizabeth Hooper in Boston, Massachusetts. Samuel was the youngest
of three boys. Martha, the only girl, died in 1337 during
childbirth. Though little is known of the Wardwell family, they
seem to have come from a modest Quaker background, and each boy was
not afforded a great inheritance. Young Samuel took an interest in
carpentry and was finishing a apprenticeship in Boston in 1664, at
the age of twenty-one, when his life would take a different course
toward the town of Salem.<br />
<br />
In 1664, Samuel's eldest brother, Eliakim, had moved to New Jersey
and became a leader among the large numbers of Quakers who had
recently moved there. At the same time, Samuel's other brother,
Benjamin, moved to Salem in search of a seaman's job in the town's
thriving commercial shipping business (Robinson 57). Young Samuel
decided to follow his brother to Salem in order to practice
carpentry. At this time, Salem was rapidly growing, as old houses
were being enlarged, and many new ones were being built .</p>
<p>Upon moving to Salem, Samuel met an unidentified woman whom he
married and they had a son named Thomas. Unfortunately, his wife
died in 1671 and Samuel moved to nearby Andover with his young son
in search of a new life. There were several prominent men living in
Andover at the time. One of these was Simon Bradstreet, a
magistrate, who had gotten into a conflict with Eliakim Wardwell.
Eliakim had called the magistrate's daughter, a "dishonest woman."
There is a good chance that the bad blood between these two
families would be a cause for Samuel's indictment for witchcraft
twenty years later. Another established resident of Andover was
Richard Barker. Barker's twenty-five year-old daughter, Sarah, fell
in love with Samuel Wardwell, and the couple planned to marry.
However, because Samuel was not a member of Andover's leading
families, the couple's plans were quickly halted.</p>
<p>Since moving to Andover, Samuel often amused his neighbors by
telling fortunes, a practice forbidden by the Puritan religion,
because it was regarded as a magical activity. It is likely that
Samuel was simply immature and practiced magic for sport. However,
several members of Andover knew of his pastime, and remembered them
years later in 1692. "He was fabled, for example to have the
strange power of getting into people's dreams, and regulating
matters there to his own fancy (Robinson 62)." In addition, he
prophesized in 1677 that a young couple in Andover would have five
daughters before they had a son. Amazingly, this turned out to be
true. Unfortunately for Wardwell, the boy was born just a few years
before the witch scare, furthering his link to the supernatural and
placing him as a suspect for witchcraft.</p>
<p>In the years prior to the witch trials, anyone dabbling in magic
or fortune telling was thought to be linked to the devil. Though
the practice of fortune telling was not uncommon among New
Englanders in the seventeenth century, Wardwell's well-known
practice of magic, albeit for sport, made him a prime target for
witchcraft accusation in 1692.</p>
<p>The final reason for Wardwell's accusation of witchcraft, was
due to his neighbors' jealousy of his sudden wealth. As can be seen
in cases of other accused persons in Salem and Andover, those who
gained or lost wealth were more prone to be accused than others. To
everyone surprise, Sarah Hawkes, a young, beautiful, twenty-two
year-old widow, with a sizable inheritance, decided to marry Samuel
Wardwell on January 9, 1673. Samuel was not a member of the gentry
and had no dowry to offer Sarah. Nevertheless, they married and
preceded to have seven children. Their three boys were Samuel, Jr.,
Eliakim, and William. Samuel and Sarah's four girls were Mercy,
Elizabeth (who died in three days), another Elizabeth, and Rebecca.
Due to Sarah's sizable inheritance and Samuel's hard work as a
carpenter, the couple lived a prosperous life with a large farm in
the south of Andover, and land in Lynn. (Robinson 62-63).</p>
<p>As the witchcraft scare rose in 1692, the Wardwells were living
comfortably on their farm. At the age of 49, Samuel was arrested on
August 15, 1692 and imprisoned in Salem Town. With him, wife Sarah
and daughters Sarah and Mercy were also accused of witchcraft.
Though Samuel was one of the last in the Salem area to be arrested,
it was not surprising that the witchcraft court tracked him down.
Not only had Wardwell dabbled in magic, but he had gained sizable
wealth for a common citizen. In addition, his brother's affront to
Andover's leading citizen, Simon Bradstreet, sealed his fate, as
most of his accusers came from Andover.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1692, Samuel confessed before magistrate John
Higginson, saying that he had indeed dabbled in the supernatural by
"telling of fortunes, which sometimes came to pass." Not only did
he confess this indiscretion, he also reported making a pact with
the devil. Wardwell confessed that the devil promised to make him
"live comfortably and be a sea captain." In return, Wardwell
promised to "honor" him, signing the devil's "book by making a mark
like a square with a black pen." Samuel Wardwell's claim seems
absurd, yet he was probably trying his best to save his life. He
knew that many people learned of his suspicious behavior as a young
man, telling fortunes. Like several others who had saved their
lives by confessing, he made up a grand tale, which included much
more demonic activity than anyone else had attributed to him.</p>
<p>Soon, however, Wardwell's conscience made him recant his
confession. Now, not only was he in a dangerous position pleading
innocent before the Court of Oyer and Terminer, but there was a
written confession, and two complaints against him. One simply
stated his use of witchcraft, another mentioned his compact with
the devil. There were also seven formal accusations which said that
Wardwell afflicted people and other statements which corroborated
his use of witchcraft and fortune telling. Not surprisingly, the
court found Wardwell guilty on September 17th. He was hanged on
September 22, 1692, along with seven women.</p>
