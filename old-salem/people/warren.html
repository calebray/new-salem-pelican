<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>At the time the Salem witchcraft trials began, Mary Warren was
twenty years old and employed as a servant in the household of John
Procter of Salem Village. Before her first formal examination on
April 19, 1692, Warren participated mildly in the afflicted girls'
accusations. Both John and Elizabeth Procter disagreed with the
conduct of the trials. Therefore, when John Procter discovered that
Mary Warren participated in the accusations he threatened to whip
her until her senses returned. After Mary Warren stayed in town the
night of Rebecca Nurse's examination, Samuel Sibley went to court
and testified to Procter's opinions about the accusers and about
Mary's participation in the accusations. Sibley claimed that:
"Proctor replyed if they [the accusers] were let alone so we should
all be Devils &amp; witches quickly they should rather be had to
the Whipping post but he would fetch his jade [Mary Warren] Home
&amp; thresh the Devil out of her &amp; more to the like purpose
crying hang them, hang them. And also added that when she [Mary
Warren] was first taken with fits he kept her close to the Wheel
&amp; threatened to thresh her, &amp; then she had no more fits
till the next day he was gone forth, &amp; then she must have her
fits again firsooth" (SWP II: 683-684)..</p>
<p>Both of Mary Warren's parents died before this stage in her
life. This situation forced Warren to become a servant and support
herself since she had no funds or property to claim. Some of Mary's
anxiety over the loss of her parents surfaced during the trials.
The document in which John DeRich accused George Jacobs, Sr.,
states, "that Mary Warrens mother did appeare to this Deponent
[John DeRich] this day with a white man and told him that goodwife
Parker and Oliver did kill her." In her statement against Alice
Parker, Mary Warren also claims that she killed her mother and
afflicted her sister, Elizabeth, "she [Alice Parker] also told me
she: bewiched my mother &amp; was a caus of her death: also that:
she bewiched my sister: Eliz: that is both deaf &amp; dumb." Having
no family and working for a man who beat her, it is not very
surprising that, when accused of witchcraft herself, Mary Warren
sought the public attention and legal protection of being an
aggressive accuser of local witches.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1692, the magistrates in Salem began their
questioning of Mary Warren. "I am innocent" were the first words
out of her mouth. At this point in the trials no one had been
hanged, so the clues as to how avoid being convicted had not yet
been discovered. Mary Warren, however, quickly learned that
assertions of innocence did not save, but following the judges'
lead during questioning did help the defendant. Warren provided
many evasive answers during her first examination, possibly because
she was unsure as to how to not be convicted. Throughout this
examination she continuously fell into fits, which often followed
the fits of the other girls in the courtroom. At one point, Mary
became so afflicted by the apparitions that tortured her that she
had to be removed from the courtroom, and Bridget Bishop was then
brought in for questioning:</p>
<p>"Afterwards she [Mary Warren] started up, &amp; said I will
speak &amp; cryed out, Oh! I am sorry for it, I am sorry for it,
&amp; wringed her hands, &amp; fell a little while into a fit again
&amp; then came to speak, but immediately her Teeth were set, &amp;
then she fell into a voilet fit, &amp; cryed out, Oh Lord help me,
Oh good Lord save me! And then afterwards cryed again, I will tell,
I will tell, &amp; then fell into a dead fit againe. And afterwards
cryed, I will tell, they did, they did, they did, &amp; then fell
into a violent fit again. After a little recovery she cryed I will
tell, I will tell, they brought me to it; &amp; then fell into a
fit again: which fits continuing, she was ordered to be had out,
&amp; the next to be brought in, viz: Bridget Byshop" (SWP II:
794).</p>
<p>Even after being brought back into the courtroom, Warren
continued her fits until the magistrates held a private meeting
with her. After that, Mary Warren began to confess and, once she
did, the court recorder noted that, "not one of the sufferers was
afflicted during her examination after once she began to confess,
though they were tormented before." While in prison, Mary Warren
changed her story. Her fits lessened, and she began to implicate
the Procters in the mysterious events occurring in Salem. Following
the examination in prison, Warren faced two more examinations: one
on April 21 and the other on May 12. Now a confessed witch, Warren
aggressively accused others of alliances with the devil. At this
point, Warren actively accused the Procters of performing certain
deeds, although she hesitated to call them a witch and a wizard. By
the end of her examinations, Mary was established as an accuser,
and she safeguarded her life by providing the magistrates with
ample accusations and evidence.</p>
<p>Mary Warren's testimony did more than save her life, it also
represented a turning point in the trials. For the first time fraud
was introduced. Yet the judges made no move to aid the innocent,
and they continued to encourage the accusers. In Edward Bishop,
Sarah Bishop, and Mary Easty's complaint against Mary Warren they
stated that, "for Said Mary warrin when I was Aflicted I thought I
saw the Apparission of A hundred persons: for Shee said hir Head
was Distempered that Shee Could not tell what Shee Said, And the
Said Mary tould us that when Shee was well Againe Shee Could not
Say that Shee saw any of Apparissons at the time Aforesaid -."
During Warren's first examination, Elizabeth Hubbard "testifyed
that a little after this Mary was well, she then said that the
afflicted persons did but dissemble." Both of these statements
suggest that either Warren was mentally unstable, or that she and
the accusers were participating in concocted lies. Keeping in mind
the above statements, Mary's remarkable description in the prison
of Giles Cory's clothes could possibly be explained by the fact
that the accusers were "dissembling" - and not that Giles Cory was
afflicting Mary at that very moment. In <i>Salem Story,</i> Bernard
Rosenthal claims Warren understood that "cooperation with the
accusers proved salutary" and that her decision to become an active
accuser provided a great lesson to others who would later employ
the same tactic.</p>
