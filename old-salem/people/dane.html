<p>Rev. Francis Dane was born around 1615 in England and died on
February 16, 1697 at the age of eighty-one in Andover,
Massachusetts. He is the son of John Dane, who settled in both
Ipswich and Roxbury. Dane's name is found among the early residents
of Ipswich in 1641, and according to Joseph Felt's <i>History of
Ipswich</i>, Dane moved to Andover in 1648. Dane became the second
pastor of the North Parish in 1649. He remained in this position
for forty-eight years until his death in 1697. In regard to his
education, Rev. Cotton Mather lists Dane as one of the young men
who finished his studies in the Colony before Harvard College
conferred degrees. In addition to his ministry, Dane founded school
for Andover youth. Dane had two sons, Nathaniel and Francis, and
four daughters, Elizabeth (Johnson), Hannah (Goodhue), Phebe
(Robinson), and Abigail (Faulkner). He himself was married three
times: Elizabeth Ingals (pre 1645-1676), Mary Thomas (1677-1689),
and Hannah Abbot (1690-his death 1697).<br />
<br />
Abiel Abbot's <i>History of Andover</i> notes that there is no
record of any discord between Dane and his congregation from 1649
to 1680, although historian Sarah L. Bailey calls the reality of
such a situation into question in her <i>Historical Sketches of
Andover</i>. Whether flawless or not, it is evident that Dane was a
highly respected and powerful member of the Andover community,
comparable only to Dudley Bradstreet, former Governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony. Around 1680, church members began to
complain about the capabilities of Dane and requested a younger,
more vibrant minister for their church. In January of 1682, the
congregation called the young Rev. Thomas Barnard, a recent
graduate of Harvard and protege of Cotton Mather. Soon thereafter,
the congregation stopped paying Dane's salary and gave Barnard a
full salary. Dane petitioned the General Court in Boston, and the
Andover church was required to pay Dane thirty pounds a year to
share pastoral duties with Barnard. The church decided to pay
Barnard fifty pounds a year, which much less than Barnard expected,
with the stipulation that when Dane retired or died, Barnard would
receive the full eighty pounds annual salary.</p>
<p>Andover church politics were fairly stagnate for the next ten
years, although it appears that the tension between Dane and
Barnard was evident throughout this time. In 1692, however, things
started to heat up when the witch hunt broke out in near by Salem
Village. By August, the hunt had stretched to Andover with an
invitation to two of the Salem accusers to come and find witches in
Andover. Rev. Barnard did much to facilitate the witch hunt,
holding prayer meetings in the church that resulted in "touch
tests" where the accusers could simply touch community members who
were then accused of witchery. Rev. Dane refused to take part in
the witch hunt from the outset, and perhaps because of this as well
as the tension between Dane, Bradstreet, and Barnard, more members
of Dane's family were accused than any other single family in the
entire episode. In addition to Dane's extended family, two of
Dane's daughters, his daughter in law, and five of his
grandchildren were accused.<br />
<br />
Upham writes, "The Rev. Francis Dane deserves to be recognized
preeminent and for a time almost alone in bold denunciation and
courageous resistance of the expiable proceedings of that dark
day." Dane was the driving force behind ending the trials in
Andover. He first arranged for the Andover children to be let out
of jail on bond in October 1692. Husbands, brothers, and fathers of
the accused witches then joined Dane in petitioning the General
Court for the release of the Andover women on the grounds that they
were needed at home and with the coming of winter would not fare
well in the prisons. On October 18, 1692, Dane wrote a petition
addressing what he believed to be the forced and false confessions
of guilt made by women during the frenzy of the "touch test," in
order to save themselves from trial and possible execution. Dane
writes that there was, "reason to think that the extreme urgency
that was used with some of them by their friends and others who
privately examined them, and the fear they were then under, hath
been an inducement to them to admit such things." This was the
first attempt to explain the confessions of those who had been
accused. Dane also wrote letters to the courts and his fellow
ministers condemning spectral evidence using such strong language
as, "I believe the reports have been scandalous and unjust, neither
will bear y light." Slander charges filed by Dane and members of
his family, particularly Abigail Dane Faulkner, did much to deter a
resurgence of accusations in Andover as well.<br />
<br />
Local historian Enders Robinson in his book <i>Salem Witchcraft</i>
concluded from the above facts that the Andover incident was a
direct conspiracy of Barnard against Dane. Although this theory
cannot be proven, and Dane was responsible for halting the Andover
proceedings, Robinson makes an unfounded assumption. Barnard was
highly respected and had studied with Cotton Mather at Harvard.
Mather was one of the top proponents of the trials and the
necessity of purging the colony of witches. Barnard was not the
only minister at the time to be lured to Mather's convincing
theological arguments. In Barnard's mind, promoting the witch
trials could very well have been the best thing he could do for his
congregation. One must also note that as Dane's resistance movement
gained momentum, Barnard sided with Dane over the courts. Robinson
believes this to be indicative of Barnard's manipulative nature.
Although this is possible, there is no evidence for Barnard's
motive in changing sides on the witchcraft issue. Regardless of the
social motives behind what occurred in Andover in 1692, Dane
immerged as a fearless and effective leader. He suffered under the
accusations of numerous members of his family, yet found the
strength to guide an entire community through an irrationality that
could have lead to many more innocent deaths had he not taken such
an outspoken, controversial, and admirable stand.</p>
