<p><b>Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature<br />
An Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia<br />
Spring Semester 2001</b></p>
<p>When Ann was arrested on May 12th 1692, she was a twice-widowed
woman of property in Salem Town. Although her testimony is
well-documented in the transcripts of the Court of Oyer and
Terminer, details of her origins before the trials of 1692 are
largely unknown. Ann is thought to have been born in England
sometime between 1622 and 1627. She married her first husband,
Thomas Greenslit (also spelled Greenslade) and had five children
with him sometime before 1677. Her name appears for the first time
in the public record of Salem Town on the certificate of inventory
for the his estate following his death in 1674.</p>
<p>The family had likely lived in Falmouth, Maine during the birth
of Ann's children, Thomas, Ruth, John, James, and Samuel, between
1650 &amp; 1660. Although the eventual whereabouts of each of her
children remains almost as unknown as Ann's own activities, her
eldest son Thomas Pudeator went on to play a central role in the
trial of the Reverend George Burroughs. He testified to the man's
extraordinary feat of strength in lifting a gun at arm's length
with just one finger in the barrel. In <i>Salem Story</i>,
historian Bernard Rosenthal suggests that this may have been a
last-ditch effort by Thomas to save his own mother from execution
by appearing to join sides with the witch-hunters.</p>
<p>Ann was left destitute after her first husband died in 1674,
probably working in the paid profession of a midwife and nurse. Her
name does not appear again until March of 1678, when she is
recorded as the wife of her neighbor Jacob Pudeator, a man about 20
years her junior. This unusual circumstance was calls attention to
the fact that Ann had served as nurse to Jacob's first wife Isabel
during her illness, and married Jacob less than a year after
Isabel's unexplained death between 1675-1676. Jacob, too, passed
away in 1682, leaving monetary bequests to each of Ann's five
children, as well as the remainder of his property to Ann herself.
Afterwards, Ann occupied the rather precarious position of being a
professional woman of property in a male-dominated society.</p>
<p>Historian Carol F. Karlsen suggests that Ann became a prime
target for allegations of witchcraft after she scolded John Best,
Jr. for returning her lost cow from his fold. Best claimed that "he
did conclude said Pudeator was a witch" because she "would chide me
when I came home from turning the cow back." In her book, <i>The
Devil in the Shape of a Woman,</i> Karlsen argues that women such
as Ann who dared to defy the Puritan gender standard of the
unassertive and docile female put themselves at great risk to be
singled out for punishment through witchcraft accusations. She also
implies that Ann's occupation of midwife, regardless of whether she
earned money (for this is not confirmed), may have threatened other
male medical professionals in Salem Town, leading to accusations.
Birth was a risky act and filled with apprehension in that time
period, loss of life during the process was often blamed on the
malignant forces of the devil at work through witchcraft.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivations for her accusers, a warrant for Ann
Pudeator and another woman, Alice Parker, was written on May 12th
1692. Pudeator was brought to trial on July 2nd, 1692. Sarah
Churchill was the first to accuse Ann of having tormented her, by
appearing with the book of the devil and asking her to sign it. She
also accused Ann of having presented her with several images of
accusing girls that she proceeded to torture like voodoo dolls with
thorns. Five more of the circle of accusing girls confirmed these
accusations - both Mary Warren and Ann Putnam falling into fits
during Pudeator's examination and then being cured by a touch of
Ann's hand. In addition to these displays, Elizabeth Hubbard, Mary
Walcott, and Sarah Bibber also presented testimony that Pudeator
had afflicted them through pinching, pressing and choking. The
constable Joseph Neal described his discovery of "curious
containers of various ointments" suspected to have been associated
with Ann's alleged witchcraft at her house upon her arrest, and
asserted that she was an "ill-carriaged woman" whom he was
convinced had adversely affected his wife in her service as
midwife. During her examination Ann insisted that these jars were
simply filled with Neat's Foot Oil. Incriminating evidence of Ann's
relation to animal familiars was given by Samuel Pickworth, who
related seeing a bird fly by one night as he walked upon Salem
Street, and soon after noticing a woman coming out of Ann's home,
presumably the same entity as the bird. Going even farther, Mary
Warren said that Pudeator had caused John Turner to fall from a
tree, and accused Ann of killing her husband Jacob, Jacob's first
wife Isabel, as well as the wives of John Best and Joseph Neal.</p>
<p>Throughout the trials, Ann remained consistent but relatively
unassertive in her declrations of innocence. She insisted that she
did not know her accusers, nor anything of the art of witchcraft.
In response to curiosity about the ointments, she simply explained
they were containers of grease to make her soap. Although her
testimony in itself was not particularly noteworthy, her petition
to the court, written before her death, merits acknowledgement for
its simple denunciation of her accusers. Bernard Rosenthal brings
this to light in his book, <i>Salem Story,</i>, pointing out that
Ann accused Mary Warren, Sarah Churchill, John Best, Sr. and Jr.,
and Samuel Pickworth of bearing false witness against her.
Particularly of note was her scathing addition that John Best Jr.
was a known liar: "the abovesaid Jno Best hath been formerly whipt
and likewise is [recorded] for a Lyar". In retrospect, this charge
cast considerable doubt upon the validity of John's accusations, as
well as the credibility of any court that would admit the testimony
of a publicly acknowledged liar.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, not one of Ann's children came to her defense
during the trials. Widowed and abandoned by her remaining kinfolk,
Ann Pudeator, at that time somewhere between 70 and 75 years old,
was hanged upon Gallows Hill on Sept. 22nd 1692, in what would be
the final set of executions resulting from the Salem Witch
trials.</p>
