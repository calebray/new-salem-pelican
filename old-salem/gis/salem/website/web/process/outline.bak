[JPEG of Upham's map]

Our primary source of geographic information for Salem in 1692 comes from a map published in 1867 in Charles W. Upham's Salem Witchcraft, With an Account of Salem Village and a History of Opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Spirits.  W.P. Upham, brother to author Charles, researched and drew the map. In his notes to the volume, Charles Upham included some details about how land grants were located and drawn, but is largely silent about how his brother located the dwellings of the major actors in the Salem narrative:

The map, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey chart, is the result of much personal exploration and perambulation on the ground.  It may claim to be a very exact representation of many of the original grants and farms.  The locality of these houses, mills, and bridges, in 1692, is given in some cases precisely, and in all with near approximation. The task has been a difficult one.  An original plot of Governor Endicott's Ipswich River grant, No. III., is in the State House, and one of the Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem town-books.  Neither of them, however, affords elements by which to establish its exact location.  A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No. XX., as its boundaries were finally determined, is in the State House, and another of the same in the court-files of the county.  This gives one fixed and known point, Hadlock's bridge, from which, following the lines by points of compass and distances, s indicated on the plot and described in the Colonial Records, all the sides of the grant are laid out with accuracy, and its place on the map determined with absolute certainty. A very perfect and scientifically executed plan of a part of the boundary between Salem and Reading in 1666 is in the State House; of which an exact tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. H.J. Coolidge, of the Secretary of State's office.  It gives two of the sides of the Governor Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner  as to afford the means of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing its locality.  There are no other plots of original or early grants or farms on this territory; but, starting from the Bishop and Bellingham grants thus laid out in their respective places, by a collation of deeds of conveyance and partition on record, with the aid of portions of the primitive stone-walls still remaining, and measurements resting on permanent objects, the entire region has been reduced to a demarkation comprehending the whole area.  The locations of then-existing roads have been obtained from the returns of laying-out committees, and other evidence in the records and files.  The construction of the map, in all its details, is the result of the researches and labors of W. P. Upham.

Screen 3: Problems with Source Material

Many problems with the source material present themselves:  the map was drawn nearly 200 years after the period it purports to represent; we have no details about how it was surveyed, or about how many of the historical sites were placed; our copy of the map is a reprint many generations removed from the manuscript, which, even if located today, would be distorted by age and decay. 

With such uncertainly in the source material, there is little reason to place a high degree of faith in the geographic accuracy of the document, or to believe that we could produce a highly accurate overlay of Upham's drawing over contemporary real-world Salem.  Precise positional detail about the location of most of the sites depicted by Upham is impossible to achieve.  

Nonetheless, W.P. Upham's map represents one of the best starting points (indeed the only starting point we have) to make educated guesses about the spatial organization of Salem Village and its environs in 1692.   Several sites important to the drama still exist, and most of these are pinpointed on Upham's map.  We decided to pursue the project of digitizing Upham's map, using GIS software, and accepting the factor of the unknown that is necessarily attached to it. 

By digitizing the map and creating an Hisotrical Salem GIS, we hope to accomplish several things: 
	<UL>
      <LI>Provide a visual interface to other documentation in the project.
      <LI>Provide a visual account of the spread of accusations and their 	retrenchment.
	<LI>Begin a set of base historical data from which to grow. 
      <LI>Encourage other cultural historians to make use of geographic analysis 	and representations to study the past. 
	</UL>
In time more accurate placement of some of these sites may be possible.  We hope that our work will provide a place to begin. 

Screen 4: About GIS Data

GIS software was first developed by the Candian government in the 1960s to inventory the vast land holdings across that nation.  They needed a highly accurate way of automating information tied to geography.  In recent years, GIS has grown rapidly and tremendously.  It's major users are still those who manage or survey physical features and infrastructures:  engineers, scientists, governments, facilities coordinators.   GIS allows these users to visually organize and spatially query vast amounts of data to answer questions more rapidly and readily.  Only recently have historians and social scientists begun to explor the power of GIS to study demography and temporal change in the physical world. 

Why use GIS software, which is designed to create highly accurate models of the geographic world, to model a printed map of doubtful accuracy?  Because GIS software provides us with a way to visualize data stored in a relational database system.  

GIS data typically represents the world through a combination of vector graphics and tabular data, stored as a series of layers.  Each layer represents only one type of feature, but may store many instances of that feature, each of which is represented by a record in a "feature attribute table."  Features can be represented as points, for discrete features, lines, for linear features, or polygons for areal features. 

For example, if you were to model the road network in your hometown, you would probably include a layer that represented the streets.  Each line in the layer would correspond to a street, and each line would have information about it--like the name of the street it represents, the addresses on that street--in the associated feature attribute table.  If you wanted to show where the stoplights in town were, you might use points to represent this information:  each point would overlay on top of the street layer, and should probably correspond to the street intersections. As with the street layer, the intersection layer would have associated information--perhaps each record would include not only the cross streets, but also the last time the lights were replaced at that stoplight.  

The process of creating such GIS data layers from a printed source is called "digitization."  Essentially, this inloves tracing the points, lines and polygons of a map using the GIS software.  To do this, one needs a set of known control points, or "tics" which would be digitized and used to anchor the rest of the digitizing.  Without tics, it is difficult to impossible to assign real world lattitude and longitude values to the data.  

Once digitized, the GIS layer, or "coverage" can be associated with sets of data recorded in other ways.

Screen 5:  Step 1:  Determine data to record off of Upham's map.

We decided to procede with digitization on two fronts:

1.  For demonstration and experimentation purposes, immediately digitize the points of Upham's map. 

2.  Simultaneously research information about existing sites depicted on Upham's map, so that the data created from this map could be matched to other contemporary data about Salem and Essex County, Massachusettes.  

This process is slightly backward from what might usually be done:  that is, we might normally have first researched existing sites to obtain a series of known "control points" that could be used to anchor the Upham map as we digitized.  However, we recognized that this would take time and effort, and we felt that it would be useful to have a point coverage of Salem available to experiment with, even if it were not "geographically aware," or referenced to a real-world coordinate system.  Later, after ascertaining control points we could reassign coordinate systems to the data and "transform" it.  This process is not without the potential for error.   However, even if it were to produce completely unacceptable results, digitizing Upham's map a second time would not be time consuming. 

The basic data, without true geographic coordinates, will be output to postscript files for use with Macromedia's Generator.  This software enables us to produce animations of the first month of Salem, showing where, when, and how quickly the accusations spread thorughout the village, and tie these animations to a queryable database.  The early results of these experiments with animated databases are <A HREF="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~cj8n/salem/salem.swf">available for viewing</A>.

We decided to scan the map at a high resolution and digitize the data from the image.  Digitizing from paper sources is potentially more time-consuming and more prone to error because of human fatigue.

Screen 6: Step 2:  Locate TICS 

Once the map was scanned, we began by developing a set of temporary tics to anchor future work on the non-referenced data.  We chose these tics based on their visibility on the map.  When precise points were identified, they would be matched to existing points on Upham's map.

[overlay of tics on map]

Screen 7:  Digitizing Points

Once the tics were digitized, we proceded to trace the points, one-by-one.  Upham used a mix of arabic numerals, alphabetical chararcters, and other glyphs to represent the dwellings and landmarks on his map.  To track these point features and link them to other information in our developing database, we assigned our own internal key number to each point:  we followed Upham's numeric system at first, then continued sequentially through the non-alphabetical characters, then the alphabetical characters.  This process produced 182 points.

Screen 8:  Digitizing Other Features

We also digitized major roads, streams and the boundary of Salem Village.  These features were less important for the data they convey than the visual reference they provide.

Screen 9:   Creating the geographic database [table]

While digitizing the map continued, we recorded Upham's own key to his map in an Access database, and linked it with information from David C. Brown, A Guide to the Salem Witchcraft Hysteria of 1692 (1997), and the Geographic Names Information System, published by the U.S. Geological Survey.   This database provides the core data to help us track the sites depicted on Upham's map, and match them to contemporary locational data, such as addresses or geographic coordinates. 

Screen 10: Overview:  Determining Real World Coordinates

The "quick and dirty" digitizing allowed us to experiment with constructing some simple demonstrations and tests to determine the usefulness and feasibility of various types of display. 

While this proceded, we began to research information about those sites known still to exist.  The plan for locating control points, matching them to Upham's map and transforming the data to match real world data was as follows: 

1.  Obtain base geographic data for area.
2.  Identify those sites on Upham's map which still exist. 
3.  Research locational information on those sites.
4.  Obtain locational data and convert to GIS data formats. 
5.  Overlay with base data. 
6.  Modify locational data as necessary to create control points. 
7.  Match existing data to control points and transform data. 

Screen 11: Sources of Base Data

To obtain accurate geographic coordinates for existing sites, we obtained a wealth of base data from the Massahusettes Geographic Information System (MassGIS) data clearinghouse (http://www.magnet.state.ma.us/mgis/).  MassGIS offers free aerial photography and digital map products through their data archive, which we obtained for local use.  These included:

     1-Meter Resolution Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles
     [sample image]

     1:25000 scale USGS Digital Quadrangles
	Based upon the Salem, Massachusettes 1:25000 map (Map ?)
     [sample image]

The U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System is the official record of United States place names for the federal government, including cultural and physical features, as well as geographic coordinates for these features (http://mapping.usgs.gov/gnis).  A CD-ROM version, on deposit at the Geostat Center in the University of Virginia Library, was used to extract our data.

The U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line database is the source for most of the commerical and non-commercial political and street data nationwide.  This data is deposited with the Geostat Center in the University of Virginia, which processed the data for Essex County, Massachusettes to produce a coverage of roads.  This road data would be used to address match the existing known sites. 

	[shot of Essex County street layer]

Screen 11:  Address Matching

The process of address geocoding, or address matching, involves comparing a precise postal address (123 Main Street) with a database of streets that contains address ranges for that street (100-199 Main Street).   GIS software products take the known address, compare it to the attribute data for street layers, and interpoloates a point on the line approximating its location.  In this example, the address of 123 Main street would be placed closer to the beginning of the street with a range of 100-199, rather than to the end.  An address of 149 would be placed almost exactly in a the middle. 

Furthermore, the Census Bureau's TIGER database is not known for it's positional accuracy.  The Bureau claims no more than 167 feet accuracy.  

Thus address matching is not an exact process.  For a project such as this, it helps us to get "in the neighborhood" of the exact point.  However, further examination of these points, in relation to other data such as aerial photography, is necessary to establish control points for the Upham Map.   

The following table shows the sites and addresses that were matched. 

[table]

The address matching process resulted in this point coverage:

Screen 12:  GNIS matching

The GNIS system provides access to coordinates of 2 million cultural and physical features in the United States.  It is not a perfect resource and, as with address matching, it provides only the starting point to locating more precise data through aerial photographs. 

Users can search the GNIS database by the name of the feature, and limit the search by geographic location.  Thus we could search for "Cedar Lake" and limit returns only to those features named "Cedar Lake" that are located within Essex County, Massachusettes.  The search returns include geographic coordinates that can be converted to points in the GIS system.  

After comparing Upham's Map with contemporary maps from the US Geological Survey, we identified these 9 features that appeared on both sources:

The returns from the search for these features resulted in the following coverage:

Screen 13:  Overlay and creation of controls

At this point, we are ready to begin the process of identifying control points using the GNIS, address matching, and aerial photography data.  These three data sources were brought together as background information in an ArcInfo editing session.  Using supplementary information from Brown's Guide and from Ben Ray's recent visits to Salem, we were able to identify with confidence those features on the aerial photographs which exactly represented the features approximated in the GNIS data and through address matching.

At this point we have a set of control points to match to the Upham Map:

[screen shot of the control1 coverage]

Before transforming the data, we have sought further help from Tom O'leary in the GIS & Mapping Office of the Essex Registry of Deeds.  O'leary had provided us with sample coordinates for a few points at the beginning stage of our research for control points.  He identified the Putnam Family Cemtary for us, which, because of it's obscure location, would have been impossible for we who are not familiar with the area.  Brown explains that the cemetary is "located off a small asphalt path which begins at the entrance road to the Massachusettes Department of Public Works on Route 62, just west of its intersection with Route 1"  (Brown, 103).  On the aerials, the site looks like this: 

[screen shot of aerial and Putnam cemetary]

It would have been difficult for us, located in Charlottesville, Virginia, to obtain these coordinates without having a partner in Essex who could ascertain "ground truth."

Because of his facilty and willingness to help, we again engaged Tom O'leary to provide us with coordinates for the sites in the address matched and GNIS point coverages.  This is duplicating efforts, but it is not wasting them:  with O'leary's help, we will be able to double-check the location of points that we had previously eyeballed.  We are confident that this will help us maintain a higher degree of locational accuracy for those existing sites than would otherwise be possible. 

The expertise of local officials has also proven valuable in correcting some errors on Upham's map.  For example, with the help of Michael Trask and other souces, we have identified the following corrections that shoule be made to Upham's index to his map:

Screen 15:  Upcoming Work on the Salem GIS Project

There are several more aspects to this project on the immediate horizon:

Transformation and Projection of GIS Data

Once our control points have been matched with the data provided by O'leary, we anticipate being able to move quickly to transform the data and register the Upham Map to these contemporary points.  At that point, we will be able to overalay all of Upham's points on top of data, including aerial photography.  We anticipate sharing this data with interested parties in Salem, and perhaps encouraging some further archeology--real or virtual--of the village. 

Building the database of Salem

Over the course of the coming year Ben Ray will be working with staff at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities to develop the database that will be matched with this geographic data.  This database will allow us to study the demography, kinship patterns, and temporal patterns in the drama in Salem. Because data will be recorded at the level of the person, and our GIS data is based on geographic features, there will be a one-to-many relationship between the geographic data and this demographic/temporal database. 

Building related GIS layers:  other historic sites (Brown)

We anticipate creating related layers of contemporary data based on Brown and other sources, and working with Michael Trask at XXXXXX to pinpoint other historic features not already visible on Upham's map.
