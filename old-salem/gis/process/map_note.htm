    <title>Note on Maps and Illustration from Upham: Salem
      Witchcraft</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>From "Map and Illustrations" in Salem Witchcraft by Charles W.
    Upham (1867), xv - xvi.</p>
    <p>The map, based upon various local maps and the Coast-Survey
    chart, is the result of much personal exploration and perambulation
    on the ground. It may claim to be a very exact representation of
    many of the original grants and farms. The locality of these
    houses, mills, and bridges, in 1692, is given in some cases
    precisely, and in all with near approximation. The task has been a
    difficult one. An original plot of Governor Endicott's Ipswich
    River grant, No. III., is in the State House, and one of the
    Swinnerton grant, No. XIX., in the Salem town-books. Neither of
    them, however, affords elements by which to establish its exact
    location. A plot of the Townsend Bishop grant, No. XX., as its
    boundaries were finally determined, is in the State House, and
    another of the same in the court-files of the county. This gives
    one fixed and known point, Hadlock's bridge, from which, following
    the lines by points of compass and distances, s indicated on the
    plot and described in the Colonial Records, all the sides of the
    grant are laid out with accuracy, and its place on the map
    determined with absolute certainty. A very perfect and
    scientifically executed plan of a part of the boundary between
    Salem and Reading in 1666 is in the State House; of which an exact
    tracing was kindly furnished by Mr. H.J. Coolidge, of the Secretary
    of State's office. It gives two of the sides of the Governor
    Bellingham grant, No. IV., in such a manner as to afford the means
    of projecting it with entire certainty, and fixing its locality.
    There are no other plots of original or early grants or farms on
    this territory; but, starting from the Bishop and Bellingham grants
    thus laid out in their respective places, by a collation of deeds
    of conveyance and partition on record, with the aid of portions of
    the primitive stone-walls still remaining, and measurements resting
    on permanent objects, the entire region has been reduced to a
    demarkation comprehending the whole area. The locations of
    then-existing roads have been obtained from the returns of
    laying-out committees, and other evidence in the records and files.
    The construction of the map, in all its details, is the result of
    the researches and labors of W. P. Upham.</p>
    <p>Index to the Map</p>
    <p>Dwellings in 1692</p>
    <p>[The Map shows all the houses standing in 1692 within the bounds
    of Salem Village; some others in the vicinity are also given. The
    houses are numbered on the Map with Arabic numerals, 1, 2, 3,
    &amp;c., beginning at the top, and proceeding from left to right.
    In the following list, against each number, is given the name of
    the occupant in 1692, and, in some cases, that of the recent
    occupant or owner of the locality is added in parentheses.]</p>
