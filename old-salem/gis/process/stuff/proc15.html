<h4>15. Final Checks: Local Area Input</h4>
<p>Before transforming the data, we have sought further help from
Tom O'Leary in the GIS &amp; Mapping Office of the Essex County
Registry of Deeds.</p>
<p>At the beginning stage of our research, Mr. O'Leary had provided
us with sample coordinates for a few points . He identified the
Putnam Family Cemetery for us, which, because of it's obscure
location, would have been impossible for we who are not familiar
with the area. Brown explains that the cemetery is "located off a
small asphalt path which begins at the entrance road to the
Massachusetts Department of Public Works on Route 62, just west of
its intersection with Route 1" (Brown, 103). On the aerials, the
site looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/screen15a.gif" width="485" height="461" /></p>
<p>It would have been difficult for us, located in Charlottesville,
Virginia, to obtain these coordinates without having a partner in
Essex County who could ascertain "ground truth."</p>
<p>Because of his facility and willingness to help, we have again
engaged Tom O'Leary to provide us with coordinates for the sites in
the address matched and GNIS point coverages. This is duplicating
efforts, but it is not wasting them: with O'Leary's help, we will
be able to double-check the location of points that we had
previously eyeballed. We are confident that this will help us
maintain a higher degree of locational accuracy for those existing
sites than would otherwise be possible.</p>
