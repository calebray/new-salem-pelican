<h4>2. Problems with Source Material</h4>
<p>Many problems with the source material present themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map was drawn nearly 200 years after the period it purports
to represent</li>
<li>We have no details about how it was surveyed, or about how many
of the historical sites were placed</li>
<li>The map scale (1 inch to the mile, or 1:63360) and the degree
of feature generalization guarantees that locational accurcy will
be low.</li>
<li>Our copy of the map is a reprint many generations removed from
the manuscript. The process of duplication has undoubtedly
introduced distortions into the drawing, which will result in error
when trying to georefences the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>With such uncertainly in the source material, there is little
reason to place a high degree of faith in the geographic accuracy
of the document, or to believe that we could produce a highly
accurate overlay of Upham's drawing over contemporary real-world
Salem. Precise positional detail about the location of most of the
sites depicted by Upham is impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, W.P. Upham's map represents one of the best
starting points (indeed the only starting point we have) to make
educated guesses about the spatial organization of Salem Village
and its environs in 1692. Several sites important to the drama
still exist, and most of these are pinpointed on Upham's map. We
decided to pursue the project of digitizing Upham's map, using GIS
software, and accepting the factor of the unknown that is
necessarily attached to it. By digitizing the map and creating an
Historical Salem GIS, we hope to accomplish several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a visual interface to other documentation in the
project.</li>
<li>Provide a visual account of the spread of accusations and their
retrenchment.</li>
<li>Begin a set of base historical data from which to grow.</li>
<li>Encourage other cultural historians to make use of geographic
analysis and representations to study the past.</li>
</ul>
In time more accurate placement of some of these sites may be
possible. We hope that our work will provide a place to begin.</td>
