        <h3>Digitizing the Upham Map</h3>
        <h4>J. Quality and Usefulness of Control Points</h4>
        <p>With control points established, we now began the process of
        registration and rectification of the Upham map image.
        <b>Registration</b> refers to the process of linking an image to
        real geographic coordinates with GIS data. <b>Rectification</b>
        refers to the transformation process in which a registered image is
        "distorted" to orient it to true north. Both steps are necessary to
        produce georeferenced points from Upham's map. Registration is a
        trial-and-error process, an art, rather than a science. It
        essentially involves significant human judgment to account for
        uncertainty, and thus introduces more error.</p>
        <p>Registration and rectification were performed in ArcInfo 7.2.1,
        which requires at least three widely dispersed control points. We
        have sixteen, but of unequal value and quality.</p>
        <p>Several of these points, and particularly those on the
        northeastern, northwestern, and southwestern corners, represented
        large area features: ponds, hills, or islands within hills. It is
        difficult to match a point (e.g., a set of precise geographic
        coordinates) with a large area feature that could contain many such
        points. Imprecise matches of these points could result in a poor
        overall transformation.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, at the outset, we could not be sure of the quality
        of Upham's points. If Upham incorrectly drew the distance between
        two sites we used as control points, linking his drawing to our
        data would involve an erroneous match.</p>
