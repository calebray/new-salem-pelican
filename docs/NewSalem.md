# New-Salem-Pelican Background

The previous Salem Witch Trials website ("Old Salem") was migrated from the Apache Cocoon 2.1 platform and TEI P4 source documents to the Pelican static site generator in September 2018. Old Salem depended on deprecated software and standards up and down its technology stack and was essentially unmaintainable going forward.

New Salem Pelican (NSP) uses the Pelican static site generator, so should require minimal ongoing maintainence. Search is provided through the Lunr.js client-side search library.
