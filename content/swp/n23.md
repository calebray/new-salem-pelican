# (Examination of [Candy](/tag/candy.html), as told by John Hale)

[July 4, 1692 ]

Among the Confessors, Anno 1692. was a Negro Woman, who charged two women to make her a Witch, describing how she see her mark in the Devils Book. And said, if she might be permitted, she would fetch the things whereby she tormented the afflicted complainers. And accordingly brought an Handkerchief, wherein several knots were tyed, raggs of Cloth, a piece of Cheese and a piece of grass And as I was credibly informed, some compelled her to swallow the grass, & that night was burned in her flesh; and one took a piece of her ragg and burnt it in the fire, and one of the Afflicted that had complained of her, was presently burned on the hand. Another piece of her rags was put under water, and then others complaintants were choaked, and strived for breath as if under water; And another ran to the River as if she would drown her self.
