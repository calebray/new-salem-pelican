# (Examination of [Rebecca Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html) )

[March 24, 1692]

The examination of [Rebekah Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html) at Salem Village

24. mar. 1691/2

[Mr. Harthorn.](/tag/harjoh.html) What do you say (speaking to one afflicted) have you seen this Woman hurt you?

Yes, she beat me this morning 

[Abigial](/tag/wilabi.html) . Have you been hurt by this Woman?

Yes 

[Ann Putman](/tag/putann2.html) in a grievous fit cryed out that she hurt her.

[Goody Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html) , here are two [An: Putman](/tag/putann2.html) the child & [Abigail Williams](/tag/wilabi.html) complains of your hurting them What do you say to it

N. I can say before my Eternal father I am innocent, & God will clear my innocency 

Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires it, but if you be guilty Pray God discover you. 

Then [Hen: Kenny](/tag/kenhen.html) rose up to speak

[Goodm: Kenny](/tag/kenhen.html) what do you say

Then he entered his complaint & farther said that since this [Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html) came into the house he was seizd twise with an amaz'd condition

Here are not only these but, here is the wife of [Mr Tho: Putman](/tag/puttho.html) who accuseth you by credible information & that both of tempting her to iniquity, & of greatly hurting her.

N. I am innocent & clear & have not been able to get out of doors these 8. or 9. dayes. 

[Mr Putman:](/tag/putedw.html) give in what you have to say

Then [Mr Edward Putman](/tag/putedw.html) gave in his relate

Is this true [Goody Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html)

I never afflicted no child never in my life 

 

You see these accuse you, is it true 

No. 

Are you an innocent person relating to this Witchcraft. 

Here [Tho: Putmans](/tag/puttho.html) wife cryed out, Did you not bring the Black man with you, did you not bid me tempt God & dye How oft have you eat and drunk y'r own damaon What do you say to them

Oh Lord help me, & spread out her hands, & the afflicted were greviously vexed 

Do you not see what a solemn condition these are in? when your hands are loose the pesons are afflicted. 

Then [Mary Walcot](/tag/walmar.html) (who often heretofore said she had seen her, but never could say or did say that she either bit or pincht her, or hurt her) & also [Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubeli.html)under the like circumstances both openly accused her of hurting them

Here are these 2 grown persons now accuse you, w't say you? Do not you see these afflicted persons, & hear them accuse you. 

The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an innocent person 

It is very awfull to all to see these agonies & you an old Professor thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the [a] effects of it & yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet -- 

You do not know my heart 

You would do well if you are guilty to confess & give Glory to God 

I am as clear as the child unborn 

What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not, yet this with me strikes hard upon you that you are at this very present charged with familiar spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now they see these familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits com to your bodily] person, now what do you say to that 

I have none Sir: 

If you have confess & give glory to God I pray God clear you if you be innocent, & if you are guilty discover you And therefore give me an upright answer: have you any familiarity with these spirits? 

No, I have none but with God alone. 

How came you sick for there is an odd discourse of that in the mouths of many -- 

I am sick at my stumach -- 

Have you no wounds 

 

I have none but old age 

You do Know whither you are guilty, & have familiarity with the Devil, & now when you are here present to see such a thing as these testify a black man whispering in your ear, & birds about you what do you say to it 

It is all false I am clear 

Possibly you may apprehend you are no witch, but have you not been led aside by temptations that way 

I have not 

What a sad thing it is that a church member here & now an other of Salem, should be thus accused and charged 

[Mrs Pope](/tag/popmis.html) fell into a grevious fit, & cryed out a sad thing sure enough: And then many more fell into lamentable fits.

Tell us have not you had visible appearances more than what is common in nature? 

I have noe nor never had in my life 

Do you think these suffer voluntary or involuntary 

I cannot tell 

That is strange every one can judge 

I must be silent 

They accuse you of hurting them, & if you think it is not unwillingly but by designe, you must look upon them as murderers 

I cannot tell what to think of it 

Afterwards when this was som what insisted on she said I do not think so: she did not understand aright what was said 

Well then give an answer now, do you think these suffer against their wills or not 

I do not think these suffer against their wills 

Why did you never visit these afflicted persons 

Because I was afraid I should have fits too 

Note Upon the motion of her body #[had] fitts followed upon the complainants abundantly & very frequently 

Is it not an unaccountable case that when you are examined these persons are afflicted? 

I have got no body to look to but God 

Again upon stirring her hands the afflicted persons were seized with violent fits of torture 

Do you beleive these afflicted persons are bewitcht

I do think they are 

 

When this Witchcraft came upon the stage there was no suspicion of [Tituba](/tag/tituba.html) ( [Mr Paris's](/tag/parsam.html) Indian woman) she profest much love to that child [Betty Paris](/tag/pareli.html) , but it was her apparition did the mischief, & why should not you also be guilty, for your apparition doth hurt also.

Would you have me bely my #[your] self -- 

she held her Neck on one side, & accordingly so were the afflicted taken 

Then Authority requiring it [Sam: Paris](/tag/parsam.html) read what he had in characters taken from [Mr Tho: Putmans](/tag/puttho.html) wife in her fitts

What do you think of this 

I cannot help it, the Devil may appear in my shap. 

This a true account of the sume of her examination but by reason of geat noyses by the afflicted & many speakers, many things are pretermitted 

Memorandum 

Nurse held her neck on one sid & [Eliz: Hubbard](/tag/hubeli.html) (one of the sufferers) had her neck set in that posture whereupon another Patient [Abigail Williams](/tag/wilabi.html) cryed out set up [Goody Nurses](/tag/nurreb.html) head the maid's neck will be broke & when some set up [Nurses](/tag/nurreb.html) head [Aaron wey](/tag/wayaar.html) observed that[Betty Hubbards](/tag/hubeli.html) was immediately righted

# (Examination of [Rebecca Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html), as Told by[Deodat Lawson)](/tag/lawdeo.html)

[March 24, 1692]

On Thursday the Twenty fourth of march, (being in course the Lecture Day, at the Village,) Goodwife N. was brought before the Magistrates Mr Hathorne and Mr Corwin, about Ten of Clock, in the Fore Noon, to be Examined in the Meeting House; the Reverend Mr. Hale, begun with Prayer, and the Warrant being read, she was required to give answer, Why she aflicted those persons? she pleaded her owne innocency with earnestness. Thomas Putman’s Wife, Abigail Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she appeared to them, and afflicted them in their fitts: but some of the other said, that they had seen her, but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which was Mary Walcut, who was presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out of her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her wrist. It was so disposed, that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of Examination, but both Magistrates and Ministers, told me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences made by her, were much after the same manner, as the former was. And her motions did produce like effects as to Biteing, Pinching, Bruising Tormenting, at their Breasts, by her Leaning, and when, bended Back, were as if their Backs was broken. The afflicted persons said, the Black Man, whispered to her in the Assembly, and therefore she could not hear what the Magistrates said unto her. They said also that she did then ride by the Meeting-house, behind the Black Man. Thomas Putman’s wife, had a grievous Fit, in the time of Examination, to the very great Impairing of her strength, and wasting of her spirits, insomuch as she could hardly, move hand, or foot, when she was carryed out. Others also were there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such an hideous scrietch and noise, (which I heard as I walked, at a little distance from the Meeting house,) as did amaze me, and some that were within, told me the whole assembly was struck with consternation, and they were afraid, that those that sate next to them, were under the influence of Witchcraft. This woman also was that day committed to Salem Prison.

# (Declaration of [Thomas Fisk](/tag/fistho.html) , Juryman)

[+ July 4, 1692  ]

July  4, 1692. I [Thomas Fisk](/tag/fistho.html) , the Subscriber hereof, being one of them that were of the Jury the last week at Salem-Court, upon the Tryal of [Rebecka Nurse,](/tag/nurreb.html) etc., being desired by some of the Relations to give a Reason why the Jury brought her in Guilty, after her Verdict not Guilty; I do hereby give my Reasons to be as follows, viz. 

When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which the Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply to [Goodwife Hobbs](/tag/hobdel.html) and her [Daughter](/tag/hobabi.html) , who had been faulty in setting their hands to the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were “What, do these persons give in Evidence against me now, they used to come among us.” After the honoured Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the  Verdict, several of the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I could not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar, but made no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a principal Evidence against her.

And I being something hard of hearing, and full of grief, none informing me how the Court took up my words, and therefore had not opportunity to declare what I intended, when I said they were of our Company.
