The Answer of [Mary Bradbury](/tag/bramar.html) in the charge of Witchcraft or  familliarity with the Divell I doe plead not guilty.

I am wholly inocent of any such wickedness through the goodness  of god that have kept mee hitherto) I am the servant of Jesus Christ  & Have given my self up to him as my only lord & saviour: and to   the dilligent attendance upon him in all his holy ordinances, in  utter contempt & defiance of the divell, and all his works as horid  & detestible; and accordingly have endevo'red to frame my life;  & conversation according to the rules of his holy word, & in that faith  & practise resolve by the help and assistance of god to contineu to  my lifes end:

for the truth of what I say as to matter of practiss I humbly  refer my self, #[my selfe,] to my brethren & neighbors that know  mee and unto the searcher of all hearts for the truth & upright-  ness of my heart therein: (human frailties, & unavoydable infirmi-  ties excepted) of which i bitterly complayne every day:/
