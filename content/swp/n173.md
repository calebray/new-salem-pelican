So that I can not but think my charge in time and mony might amount to 20 pounds besides my trouble & sorrow of heart in being deprived of her after such a manner which this world can never make me any compensation for.

I order & appoint my son Jacob Esty to carry this to the Honored Committee Appointed by the Honored Generall Court & are to meet at Salem

The humble Representation of Sam'll: Nurse of the damage sustained by our family in the year 1692 by reason of the Imprisonment condemnation and Execution of my Honoured Mother [Rebekah Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html) for supposed Witchcraft

1. We were at the whole charge of provideing for her dureing her Imprisonm't in Salem and Boston for the space of almost four months 

2. And also we spent much time and made many Journys to Boston & Salem & other places in order to have vindicated her Innocency. 

3 And altho we produced plentifull testimony that my honoured and Dear mother had led a blameless life from her youth up -- yet she was condemned and executed upon such Evidence as is now Generally thought to be Insufficient, which may be seen in the court record of her tryall. 

 

4 And so her Name and the name of her Posterity lyes under reproach the removeing of which reproach is the principal thing wherein we desire restitution. 

5 And as we know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way; so we know not how to compute our charge but shall leave it to the judgm't. of others, and shall not be critical but ready to receive such a satisfaction as shall be by the Honourable Court judged sufficient -- so Praying God to Guide unto such Methods as may be for his Glory and the good of this land -- I rest

The Influence and Energy of the Evil Spirits so great at that time acting in and upon those who were the principal accusers and Witnesses proceeding so far as to cause a Prosecution to be had of persons of known and good reputation, which caused a great disatisfaction and a stop to be put thereunto until theire Majesty's pleasure should be known therein: And upon a Representation thereof accordingly made her late Majesty Queen Mary the second of blessed memory by Her Royal Letter given at her Court at Whitehall the fifteenth of April 1693. was Graciously pleased to approve the care and Circumspection therein; and to Will and require that in all proceedings ag't persons accused for Witchcraft, or being possessed by the devil, the greatest Moderation and all due Circumspection be used, so far as the same may be without Impediment to the Ordinary course of Justice. 

And some of the principal Accusers and Witnesses in those dark and severe prosecutions have since discovered themselves to be persons of profligate and vicious conversation.

To the honourable, the Gentlemen of the Committee sitting at  Salem  Feb. 19. 1711-12 
Whereas my mother [Sarah Wardel](/tag/warsar1.html) was condemned by the court at Salem sometime in January in the year 1692, as I suppose will appear by the Records of the Tryalls at that Court, but her name is not inserted in the late Act of the Generall Court, for the taking of the Attainder of those that were condemned in that year my mother being since deceased, I thought it my duty to endeavour that her name may have the benefit of that Act. I therefore humbly pray your Honours to Represent this case to the Honourable Gen'll Court, that my mothers name may be inserted in the said Act. And whereas in the account which I gave to your Honors when you met at Salem the Last winter, I mentioned only what was seized of my Father's Estate by the Sherriffe, but gave no account of other charges which did arise from the imprisonment of my Father and mother, they having provided for their own subsistance while they were in Prison, and I suppose there was something considerable payd to the keeper of the prison, though I am not able now to give a particular account how much it was. If your Honours please to allow me something opon that account, It will be thankfully acknowledged by [you] Your honours most humble servant

Forasmuch as in the year of our Lord one Thousand Six hundred ninety two Several Towns within this Province were Infested with a horrible Witchcraft or Possession of devils: And at a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer holden at Salem in the County of Essex in the same year 1692.

The Influence and Energy of the Evil Spirits so great at that time acting in and upon those who were the principal accusers and Witnesses proceeding so far as to cause a Prosecution to be had of persons of known and good reputation. which caused a great Disatisfaction and a Stop to be put thereunto until their majesty's pleasure should be known therein.

And upon a Representation thereof accordingly made, Her late Majesty Queen Mary the Second of blessed Memory, by Her royal Letter given at Her Court at Whitehall the fifteenth of April 1693. was Graciously pleased to approve the care and Circumspection therein; and to will and require that in all proceedings agt persons accused for Witchcraft, or being possessed by the devil, the greatest moderation and all due circumspection be used, So far as the same may be without Impediment to the ordinary cause of Justice.

And Some of the principal accusers and Witnesses in those dark and severe prosecutions have since discovered themselves to be persons of profligate and vicious conversation.

Upon the humble Petition and Suit of several of the sd persons and of the Children of others of them whose Parents were Executed.

Be it Declared and Enacted by his Excellency the Governor Council and Representatives in General Court assembled and by the Authority of the same

That the several convictions Judgements and Attainders against the said [George Burroughs](/tag/burgeo.html), [John Proctor](/tag/projoh.html), [George Jacob](/tag/jacgeo1.html), [John Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html), [Giles Core](/tag/corgil.html) and--.Core, [Rebecca Nurse](/tag/nurreb.html), [Sarah Good](/tag/goosar.html), [Elisabeth How](/tag/howeli.html), [Mary Easty](/tag/easmar.html), [Sarah W[ild]](/tag/wilsar.html) [Abigail Hobbs](/tag/hobabi.html), [Samuel Wardell](/tag/warsam.html), [Mary Parker](/tag/parmar.html), [Martha Carrier](/tag/carmar1.html), [Abigail Falkner](/tag/fauabi1.html), [Anne Foster](/tag/fosann.html), [Rebecca Eame[s]](/tag/eamreb.html), [Mary Post](/tag/posmar.html), [Mary Lacey](/tag/lacmar1.html), [Mary Bradbury](/tag/bramar.html) and [Dorcas H[oar]](/tag/hoador.html) and every of them Be and hereby are reversed made and de[clared] to be null and void to all Intents, Constructions and purposes wh[atso]ever, as if no such Convictions, Judgments or Attainders had ever [been] had or given. And that no penalties or fforfeitures of Goods or Chattels be by the said Judgments and attainders or either of them had or Incurr'd.

Any Law Usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding. And that no Sheriffe, Constable Goaler or other officer shall be Liable to any prosecution in the Law for anything they then Legally did in the Execution of their respective offices.----
