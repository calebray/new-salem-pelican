In some of the fitts that I had afterwards, I was sensless and knew not that I saw who it was that afflicted me. In one fitt (upon the beginning it) I thought I saw [goodw Jackson](/tag/jaceli.html) and [widow Scott](/tag/scomar.html) come waking into the chamber with y'r staves, one of them came & sat upon me so that I could not stirr; [Goodw Jackson](/tag/jaceli.html) I saw no more, no know I that she did me any harm. In another fitt I saw the appearance of s'd [Scott](/tag/scomar.html) in the room who afflicted me, and being speechless, I continued so, untill I went to the s'd [Scott](/tag/scomar.html), who taking me by the hand, I had the liberty of speech again as formerly. The last fitt I had was upon the last Sabb'th day, in which I saw the shapes of four women or five, of whom [widow Scott](/tag/scomar.html) was one, the rest I knew not, nor knew that any did hurt me, unless s'd [widow Scott](/tag/scomar.html).

Earnest she was for me to bring her wood: denied her; soon after this one of my cattell was dead in the stantiall, and stood up on his hind feet, and kneeled on his knees afore, and little after this another of my cattell was ded in the yard, his neck under a plank at the barn side as if he were chok'd; and after this, and ever since, had hard thoughts of this woman and my neighbours told me, something more then ordinery that my cattell died so.
