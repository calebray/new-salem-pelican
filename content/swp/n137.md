Why it is a strange thing? 

No it is no strange thing that God will not suffer a Wizard to pray to him. There is also the jury of Inquest that will bear hard against you -- therefore confesse. Have you never wisht harm to your neighbors? 

No never #[in my life] since I had a being.

Whither my not answering his desire did not offend him, I cannot tell, but I was jealous afterwards that it did. A little after my wife & I went to Boston at the last Election, when I was as well in health as in many yeares before, & the Election day coming to my brother Lf't [Richard Way's](/tag/wayric.html) house, at noon there were many friends to dine there, they were sat down at the Table, [Mr Lawson](/tag/lawdeo.html) & his wife & severall more, [John Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) came into the house with my sone [Henry Wilkins](/tag/wilhen.html) before I sat down, & s'd [Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) to my apprehension lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any, I did but step into the next room, & I was presently taken in a strange condition, so that I could not dine, nor eat any thing, I cannot express the misery I was in for my water was sodainly stopt, & I had no benefit of nature, but was like a man on a #(wrack) Rack, & I told my wife immediately that I was afraid that [Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) had done me wrong, my pain continuing & finding no relief my jealousie continued: [Mr Lawson,](/tag/lawdeo.html) & others there, were all amazed, & knew not what to do for me: There was a Woman accounted  skilfull came hoping to help me, & after she had used means, she askt me whither none of those evil persons had done me damage. I said, I could not say they had, but I was sore afraid they had, she answered she did fear so too, as near as I remember. I lay in this case .3. or. .4. dayes at Boston, & afterwards with the jeopardy of my life (as I thought) I came home, & then some of my friends coming to #(se) see me (& at this time [John Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) was run away) One of the afflicted persons [Mercy Lewes](/tag/lewmer.html) came in with them, & they askt whither she saw any thing: She said yes, they are looking for [John Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) but there he is upon his Grandfathers Belly (& at that time I was in greivius #(parts) pain in the small of my Belly) #(I sent my) I continued so in greivous pain & my water much stopt till s'd [Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) was in chains, & then as near as I can guess I had considerable ease, but on the other hand in the room of a stoppage, I was vexed with a flowing of water, so that it was hard to keep my self dry. On the .5. July last talking with some friends about [John Willard](/tag/wiljoh4.html) some pleading his innocency & my self & some others arguing the contrary, within about 1/4 of an hour after that I had said it was not I, nor my son [Benj'n Wilkins](/tag/wilben.html) , but the testimony of the afflicted persons, & the jury concerning the Murder of my Grandson [Dan: Wilkins](/tag/wildan.html) that would take away his life if any thing did, & within about 1/4 hour after this was taken in the sorest distress & misery my water being turned into real blood, or of a bloody colour & the old pain returned excessively as before which continued for about 24. houres together
