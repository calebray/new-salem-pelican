# (Examination of [Elizabeth How](/tag/howeli.html) )

[May 31, 1692 ]

The examination of Eliz:  31. May. 1692 

[Mercy Lewis](/tag/lewmer.html) & [Mary Walcot](/tag/walmar.html) fell in a fit quickly after the examinant came in

[Mary Walcot](/tag/walmar.html) said that this woman the examinant had pincht her & choakt this month. [Ann Putman](/tag/putann2.html) said she had hurt her three times.

What say you to this charge? Here are them that charge you with witchcraft 

It it was the last moment I was to live, God knows I am innocent of any thing in this nature 

Did not you take notice that now when you lookt upon [Mercy Lewis](/tag/lewmer.html) she was struck [down?]

I cannot help it. 

You are charged here; what doe you say? 

I am innocent of any thing of this nature. 

Is this the first time that ever you were accused? 

Yes S'r. 

Do not you know that one at Ipswitch hath accused you? 

This is the first time that ever I heard of it 

You say that you never heard of these folks before 

[Mercy Lewis](/tag/lewmer.html) at length spake & charged this woman with hurting & pinching her: And then [Abigail Williams](/tag/wilabi.html) cryed she hath hurt me a great many times, a great while & she hath brought me the book.

[Ann Putman](/tag/putann2.html) had a pin stuck in her hand

What do you say to this? 

I cannot help it. 

What consent have you given? 

[Mary Warren](/tag/warmar.html) cryed out she was prickt

[Abig: Williams](/tag/wilabi.html) cryed out that she was pincht, & great printes were seen in her arm.

Have not you seen some apparition -- 

No, never in all my life 

Those that have confessed, they tell us they used images & pins, now tell us what you have used. 

You would not have me confess that which I know not 

She lookt upon [Mary Warren](/tag/warmar.html), & said [Warren](/tag/warmar.html) violently fell down.

Look upon this maid viz: [Mary Walcot](/tag/walmar.html) , her back being towards the examinant [Mary Warren](/tag/warmar.html) & Ann Putman said they saw this woman upon her. [Susan: Sheldon](/tag/shesus.html) saith this was the woman that carryed  her yesterday to the Pond [Sus: Sheldon](/tag/shesus.html) carried to the Examinant in a fit & was well upon grasping her arm.

You said you never heard before of these people 

Not before the warrant was served upon me last Sabbath day 

[John Indian](/tag/indjoh.html) cryed out O she bites, & fell into a grevious fit, & so carried to her in his fit & was well upon her grasping him.

What do you say to these things, they cannot come to you? 

S'r. I am not able to give account of it 

Cannot you tell what keeps them off from your body? 

I cannot tell, I know not what it is? 

That is strange that you should do these things & not be able to tell how. 

This is a true account of the examination of [Eliz: How](/tag/howeli.html) taken from my characters written at the time thereof. Witness my hand
