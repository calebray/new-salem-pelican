[Mary Warin](/tag/warmar.html) & others of the afflicted: were struck down into:  fitts & Helped up out of their fitts by a touch of [Abig'l folkn'rs](/tag/fauabi1.html)  hand: she was urged to confes the truth:for the creddit of hir Town:  her Cou[zbar ] Eliz Jonson urged her: with that: but: she refused to do it  saying god would not: require her to confess that: that she was not  gilty of Phelpses daughter complayned her afflicting her: but: she  denyed: that she had any thing to doe with witchcraft she s'd [falkn'r](/tag/fauabi1.html)  had a cloth in her hand: that when she squeezed in her hand the  afflicted; fell into greevous fits: as was observed: the afflicted sayd  [Dan'll Eames](/tag/eamdan.html) & Capt floyd was upon that cloth when it was upon  the table

August 30, 1692  [Abig'l Fokner:](/tag/fauabi1.html) before: their Majestt's Justices  at first denyed witchcraft as she had done before: but afterward:  she owned: that: she was Angry at what folk s:d when her Cou[zbar ]  Eliz. Jonson was taken up: & folk laught & s'd her sister Jonson  would come out next: & she did look with an evil eye on the af-  flicted persons & did consent that they should be afflicted: becaus  they were the caus of bringing her kindred out: and she did wish  them ill & her spirit being raised she did:pinch her hands together:  & she knew not but that the devil might take that advantage but it  was the devil not she that afflicted them: this she s'd she did at  [Capt Chandlers](/tag/chacap.html) garison: the Night after: Eliz Jonson had bin ex-  amined before [Capt Bradstreet](/tag/bradud.html) in the day
