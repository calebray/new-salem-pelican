gap as we fear: If not timely prevented will Lett out peace and ordor: and let In confusion and every evell work: 4: as things drew to a conclusion when you mett with us: you did seem on both parts to be under a conviction of the nesiescity of peace: and there was some promising appearance of mutuall condescension and that for the future you would on all hands study to be quiett: and to that end you Desiered us: to give you such advice as we judged would conduce to the promotion of righteousnes peace and ordor among you: thus you have our sence of the matter as to what is past and present: and att your Request wee shall give you what is with us to Direct by way of advice to prevent contention and troble for the future: that it may not Devour for ever and that if the Lord please you may be happier henceforth then to Make one another Miserable and not make your place uncomfortable to your present: and undesirable to any other Minister: and the Ministry it self in agrate measure unprofitable: and that you may not bring Impositions on yourselves by convincing all about you that you cannot or will not use your Liberty as becomes the ghospill: as also in testimony of the care we Have of you and our unfeigned Desier and endeavour of your peace and welfare-For these ends we advise youthat you Desist at present from urging the ordination of Thee Reverend Mr: Lawson till your spirits are better quieted and composed-that you encourage Him in his Ministerial work from time to time by an honest fulfilling of your Last Agreement with Him till [40] Till such time as He is ordained amongst you unless any juster cause shall appear to the contrary then any yet hath Done-That the last Agreement about His Maintenance be not held binding after the time of His ordination unless that act be again confirmed by Full and free consent of the major part of the Householders Lawfully called to gether upon sufficient notice of time place and end of the meeting: yea if more then A meer Major part should not consent to it: we should be loth To Advise our Bretheren to proceed but Rather advise upon that condition that some other way may be propounded as may be acceptable to Mr. Lawson and may be more pleasing to the people: as part mony and part as mony or part money and part In pay at common price so as Mr: Lawson be not endammaged and the people better pleased: we confiding in Mr: Lawsons readiness to comply with any proposition that will suite with the condition of His family-we advise all possible care be taken for the future to prevent the grievanc objected about the choise of thee committee though we cannot totally comply with that proposition which pretends a court ordor for choising a committee with out your own Limits seing we find no such ordor but a committee nominated and appointed by thee court in case of Disagreemeet Among your selves: two of which three are dead we advise therefore that whilest this contention lasts one at Least of the Town of Salem out of your Limits be fairly Chosen as one of your Committee and that the Householders Have Liberty to chuse the Rest of themselves or other wise as they pleaseWe advise the old Book of Records be kept in Being and that such votes in it as are offensive to any come to a further consideration in some lawful meeting appointed to that end: that all inconvenient votes may be Repealed or Regulated to satisfaction and such Repeals and Regulations be Inserted in the new Book of Records and all [41] other votes fairly fully and Impartially transcribed and for the future that no votes be Recorded But in thee presence of thee assembly that votes them: or at least at the next Lawfull Meeting being again publickly Read which If it be done and the vote read publickly after it is Recorded will undoubetdly prevent any Reflection for the future upon the Book or Book Keeper Finally we think peace cheap if it may be procured by complying with the aforementioned particulars which are few: fair: and easy: and that they will hardly pass for Lovers of peace: truth and Ministry and ordor in the Day of the Lord that shal so lean to their own understanding and will: that they shall reffuse such easy methods for the obtaining of them: and if peace and Agreement amongst you be once comfortably obtained we advise you with all convenient speed to go on with your Intended ordination and so we shall follow our advise with our prayers: But if our advise be Rejected we wish you better and harts to follow it : and onely add if you will unreasonably trouble your selves We pray you not any further to trouble us: we Leave all to the Blessing of God thee wonderfull Counsellour and your own serious consideration praying you to Read and consider the whole and then act as God shall Direct you Farewell- Bartholomue Gidney John Hathorne William Brown junr John Higginson Nickolas Noyes Salem February:14th 1686 7"}, {"id": "", "slug": "d1e3739", "title": "[42] Salem village this: 11th of

Q. Do you know Goody Cloyse and Goody Proctor ? A. Yes, here is Goody Cloyse . (Cloyse) when did I hurt thee? A. A great many times. (Cloyse) Oh! you are a grievous liar. Q.

About forty, and Goody Cloyse and Goody Good were their deacons. Q. What was it? A. They said it was our blood, and they had it twice that day. Q. Mary Walcot! have you seen a white man?

Elizabeth Procter ! you understand whereof you are charged, viz. to be guilty of sundry acts of witchcraft; what say you to it?

Yes, Sir. -- Again, Abigail Williams and Ann Putman were spoke to by the court, but neither of them could make any answer, by reason of dumbness or other fits. Q. What do you say Goody Procter to these things? A. I take God in heaven to be my witness, that I know nothing of it, no more than the child unborn. Q. Ann Putman! doth this woman hurt you. A. Yes Sir, a great many times. -- Then the accused looked upon them and they fell into fits. Q. She does not bring the book to you, does she? A.

There is another judgement, dear child. -- Then Abigail and Ann had fits. -- By and by they cried out, look you there is Goody Procter upon the beam. -- By and by, both of them cried out of Goodman Procter himself, and said he was a wizard. -- Immediately, many, if not all of the bewitched, had grievous fits. -- Q. Ann Putman! who hurt you? A. Goodman Procter and his wife too. -- Afterwards some of the afflicted cried, there is Procter going to take up Mrs. Pope's feet. -- And her feet were immediately taken up. -- Q. What do you say Goodman Proctor to these things? A. I know not, I am innocent. -- Abigail Williams cried out, there is Goodman Procter going to Mrs. Pope , and immediately, said Pope fell into a fit. -- You see the devil will deceive you; the children could see what you was going to do before the woman was hurt. I would advise you to repentance, for the devil is bringing you out. -- Abigail Williams cried out again, there is Goodman Procter going to hurt Goody Bibber; and immediatelyGoody Bibber fell into a fit. There was the like of Mary Walcot , and divers others. -- Benjamin Gould gave in his testimony, that he had seen Goodman Corey and his wife, Procter and his wife, Goody Cloyse , Goody Nurse , and Goody Griggs in his chamber last thursday night. -- Elizabeth Hubbard was in a trance during the whole examination. -- During the examination of Elizabeth Procter , Abigail Williams and Ann Putman ,  both made offer to strike at said Procter ; but when Abigail's hand came near, it opened, whereas it was made up into a fist before, and came done exceeding lightly, as it drew near to said Procter , and at length with open and extended fingers, touched Procter's hood very lightly. Immediately Abigail cried out, her fingers, her fingers, burned, and Ann Putman took on most greviously, of her head, and sunk down.Salem, April 11th, 1692.

What God may have Left them to, we Cannot Go into Gods pavillions Cloathed w'th Cloudes of Darknesse Round About.But as to what we have ever seen, or heard of them -- upon o'r Consciences we Judge them Innocent of the crime objected.

Mr. Mather, Mr. Allen , Mr. Moody , Mr. Willard, and Mr. Bailey.Reverend Gentlemen.The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn, having Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers, Jewries, and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into close Prison, which we know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen, who would not confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of making them confess that they never did, by reason they said one had been a  Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their Mother had made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William Procter , when he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty, when he was Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be granted that we can have our Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have these Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and beseeching you would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby you may be the means of saving the sheeding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants,JOHN PROCTER , etc. ( Robert Calef , More Wonders of The Invisible World [ London, 1700 ], excerpted in Burr, ed. , Narratives of the Witchcraft Cases, pp. 362-364 .)"}, {"id": "", "slug": "n108", "title": "n108: Sarah Proctor", "content": ""}, {"id": "n108.1", "slug": "n108", "title": "n108: Sarah Proctor", "content": "(Complaint of Thomas putnam & John putnam v.

Mary Warren affirmed that she never saw the s'd woman before only in apparition, and then she told her that her Name was Abigail Soams and that she was sister to John Soams of Preston Cooper, and that she Lived att Gaskins, and that she had lain Bedrid a year. Being asked whether she was sister to John Soams she answered peremptorily she would not tell, for all was false that Warren said. furthermore Warren affirmed that she told her, that she viz the s'd Soams was the Instrumental Means of the death of Southwick, Upon which s'd Soams casting her Eye on Warren struck her into a dreadful fitt, and bitt her so dreadfully, that the Like was never seen on any of the aflicted, which the s'd Warren Charged the s'dSoams with doeing off, saying that the s'd Soams told her this day she would be the death of her. further Warren Affirms  that she the s'd Soams ran two pinns into her side this day, which being plucked out the blood ran out after them. Goody Gaskin being present att this Examination affirmed she had kept her Bed for most parts these thirteen months--Warren further affirms she told her that when she did goe abroad att any time it was in the Night which Goody Gaskin being present Confirmed the same, that that was the Usual time off her goeing abroad -- furthermore Warren affirmed that this Abigail Soams would have had her to have made a bargain with her, telling her if she would not tel of her being a sickly woman, she would not afflict her any more, and that then she should goe along with her, for the s'd Soams told her, she was her God, Upon w'ch Warren answered she would not keep the Devils Councel. Soams told her she was not a Devil but she was her God. After this appearing three times more to her, she s'd att one of those times she was as good as a God. Q. Mary Warren is this true? A. It is nothing but the truth. Soams being asked who hurt Warren in the time of her fits she Answered it was the Enemy hurt her. I have been said she myself distracted many a time, and my senses have gone from mee, and I thought I have seen many a Body hurt mee, and might have accused many as well as she doth. I Really thought I had seen many persons att my Mothers house at Glocester, and they greatly aflicted me as I thought: Soams being Commanded while Warren was in a dreadful fit, to take Warren by the hand, the said Warren immediately recovered;  this Experiment was tried three times over and the Issue the same. Warren after a Recovery being commanded to touch the s'd Soams although she assayed several times to do it with great Earnestness she was not able, But fell down into a dreadful fit, Upon which the s'd Soams being Commanded take Warren by the hand, she immediately recovered her again, Warren affirming she felt something soft in her hand, (her Eyes then being first shut) which revived her very heart. Warren being asked what the Reason was she could not Come to touch Soams affirmed she saw the apparition of Soams come from her Body, and would meet her, and thrust her with Violence back again, not suffring her to Come near her -- sometimes Soams would say it was distraction in talking she would often Laugh, upon which Laughing the aflicted person would presently fal into a fit. Soams being asked whether she thought this was witchcraft, or whether there were any Witches in the world, answered she did not know any thing but said itt was the Enemy or some Other wicked person or the Enemy himself that forces persons to afflict her att this time, presently this Warren fell into a trance, comeing out of which she affirmed, that, Soams told her in the time of her trance that she would thrust an Awl into her very heart and would kil her this night. Soams could never cast her Eye upon Warren, but immediately she struck her down, and one time she affirmed s'd Soams struck her such a Blow as almost killed, which made the s'd Warren break out into abundance of tears. Soams being Charged with it, instead of bewailing itt, Broke forth into Laughter. Warren being also afflicted by the wringing of her mouth after a strange, and prodigious manner, Soams being Command'd to look upon her in that fit, peremptorily answered she would not, same being by being ordered to turn her face about to look on the afflicted, which being accordingly done, she shut her Eyes Close, and would not look on her being then ordered to touch her she did and immediately Warren Recovered, which no sooner done but Soams opened her Eyes and looked on the afflicted, and struck her into another most dreadful and terrible fit, and in this manner she practised her Witchcrafts severall times before the Court. Mary Warren Looking on her affirmed this to be the very woman that had so often afflicted her dureing the Examination and Charged her with it to her face. sometimes dureing the Examination Soams would put her oun foot behind her Other leg, and immediately Warrens Legs would be twisted that it was impossible for the strongest man there to Untwist them, without Breaking her Leggs,  as was seen by many present--After this Examination Warren says the apparition of Proctor Nurse and Burroughs that appeared before her, and Burroughs bitt her which bite was seen by many. Also Burroughs att the same time appeared to Margaret Jacobs who was then present, and told her as Jacobs affirmed, that her Grandfather would be hanged Upon which the s'd Jacobs wept. it was also Observed by the Rev'd M'r Noyse, that after the needle was taken away from Soams, that Warren was neither bit, not pinched by the s'd Soams, but struck so dreadfully on her breast, that she cryed out she was almost killed.

Increase Mather's Report of his Conversation in Prison with Martha Tyler )Goodwife Tyler did say, that when she was first apprehended, she had no fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made her confesse against herself; but since, she had found to her great grief, that she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself: she said, that, when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode with her, and that all along the way from Andover to Salem, her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised out of their fitts, and urging her to confess herself a witch; She as constantly told him, that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and begg'd him not to urge her to confesse; however when she came to Salem, she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side and Mr. John Emerson on the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch, and that she saw the devill before her eyes at that time (and accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat him away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confess, that she wished herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson told her once and again, Well, I see you will not confesse! Well, I will now leave you, and then you are undone, body and soul, forever.' Her brother urged her to confesse, and told her that, in so doing, she could not lye: to which she answered,Good brother, do not say so, for I shall lye if I confess, and then who shall answer unto God for my lye?' He still asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so many good men to be in such an errour about it, and that she would be hang'd if she did not confesse, and continued so long and so violently to urge and press her to confesse, that she thought verily her life would have gone from her, and became so terrifyed in her mind, that she  own'd, at length, almost any thing that they propounded to her; but she had wronged her conscience in so doing, she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself, and desired to mourn for it so long as she lived: This she said and a great deal more of the like nature. and all with such affection, sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning, as that it exceeds any pen to describe and express the same.(Charles W.

Mary Warren cryed out, oh he bites meAnn Putnam cryed out much of himOpen your mouth, don't bite your lips. I will stand with my mouth open, or I will keep it shut: I will stand any how, if you will tell me how. Ann Putnams evidence readDo you hear this evidence read? Yes I do hear it. Susan: Sheldons testimony readWhat do you say to this murdering & Bewitching your relations? One would think (said he) that no creature except they belong to hell from their Cradle would be guilty of such things. You say, you will bewitch your Grandfather because he prays that the Kingdom of Sathan may be thrown down The examinant began a large oration We do not send for you to Preach. Ben: Wilkins testifyed for all his natural affections he abused his wife much & broke sticks about her in beating of herYou had need to boast of your good affections There are a great many lyes told, I could desire my wife might be called Peter Prescot testifyed that he with his own mouth told him of beating his wife.It seems very much one of your confidence & ability to speak, should be no more #[in] courageous than to run away: by your running away you tell all that #[world] you are afraid The examinant called upon Aaron Wey & urged him #[before] to speak if he knew anything against himAaron Wey if I must speak I will, I can say you have been very cruel to poor creatures.Let some persons goe to him Ann Putnam said she would go.He said let not that person but another come. John Indian  cryed out Oh! he cuts me.Susan: Sheldon said there is the black man whispering in his ear, & he should not confessWhat do you say to this? S'r, I heard nothing, nor see nothing. Susan: Sheldon tryed to come near him but fell down immediately, & he took hold of her hand with a great deal of do, but she continued in her fit crying out, O John Willard , John Willard & #[the ex]What was the reason you could not come near him? The black man stood between us. They cannot come near any that are accused. Why do you say they could not come near any that were accused: You know Nehemiah Abbet they could talk with him.Mary Warren in a great fit carried to him & he clasping his hand upon her arm was well presently.Why said he was it not before so with Susannah Sheldon?Because said she the standers by you did not Clasp your hand before. The like said the Constable and others. They all or most testifyed that the dead those that he had murdered were now about him. Do you think these are Bewitcht?Yes, I verily believe it. Well others they have accused it is found true on & why should it be false in you? Sus. Sheldon & Mary Warren testify that now h[torn] appearance come from his body & afflicts them.What do you think of this? How comes this to pass? It is not from me. I know nothing of it You have taxt your self wonderfully, it may be you do not think of it. How so? You cryed up your tender affections and here round about they testify your cruelty to man & beast, & by your flight you have given great advantage to the Law, things will bear hard upon you, if you can therefore find in your heart to repent it is possible you may obtain mercy & therefore bethink your self S'r I cannot confess that I do not know Well but if these things are true Heaven & Earth will rise up against you. I am as innocent as the child that is now to be born. Can you pray the Lords prayer? Yes. Well let us hear you. He stumbled at the threshold (that is the #(beging) beginning) & said Maker of Heaven & Earth. He began #[against] again & mist It is a strange thing, I can say it at another time. I think I am bewitcht as well as they & laughtAgain he began & said trespass against & mist us. He began again, & cryed being puzled Well this is a strange thing I cannot say it He begun again & could not say it Well it is these wicked ones that do so overcome me Josh: Rea Sen'r gave in testimony that last night he said he hoped he should confess tho he had a hard heart, but, but he hoped he should confess.Well say w't you will confess. I am as innocent as the child unborn. Do not you see God will not suffer you to pray to him, are not you sensible of it? Why it is a strange thing. No it is no strange that God will not suffer a wizard to pray to him. There is also the jury of inquest for murder that will bear hard against you. Therefore confess. Have you never wisht harm to your Neighbours? Never since I had a being. Well confess & give glory to God. Take counsell. I desire to hearken to all good counsell. If it was the last time I was to speak I am innocent.

Bishop's house would have been a house of  great prophainness & iniquity.But as to Christian Trask the next news I heard of her was that  she was distracted & asking her husband Trask when she was so taken  [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came  from] my house when shee complained against Goody Bishop .She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by  fasting & prayer & the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd [Trask]  to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction  (& took it then to bee only distraction, yet fearing sometimes  somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at  Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be much like some of  theirs.The said Trask when recovered as I understood it did manifest  strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd Bishop's  wife & showed so much aversness from having any conversation that  I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd Goody Bishop at that  time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd Christian Trask [was]  agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the pub-  l[i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance & so continued sometimes  better sometimes worse unto her death, manifesting that shee under  temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else.I enquired of Marg'rt Ring who kept at or nigh the house, what  shee had observed of s'd Trask before this last distraction shee told  [mee.] Goody Trask was much given to reading & search the pro-  phecys of scrip[ture].The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house  she[e] came home & said shee had been w'th Goody Bishop & that  they two were now friend or to that effect.I was oft praying w'th & councelling of Goody Trask before her  death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed  more rationall & earnestly desired Edw: Bishop might be sent for  that shee might make friends with him, I asked her if shee had  wronged Edw. Bishop shee said not that shee knew of unless it were  in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them  & throwing them into the fyre & if she did evill in it she was very  sorry for it & desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her.  this was the very day before she dyed, or a few days before.Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in  those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers  & the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her  behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe & I judge was  her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand.As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice  of her wind pipe cutt out. & another wound above that threww the   windpipe & Gullet & the veine they call jugular. So that I then judge  & still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of  cissars to mangle her selfe so without some extraordinary work of  the devill or witchcraftsigned. 20. may 1692  by *John Hale.

The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted people with the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others prevailed with mee to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering what witchcraft might be at the bottome or whether it were not a possession. The chief Judge in this Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest were persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon. When the Court came to sitt at Salem in the County of Essex they convicted more than twenty persons of being guilty of witchcraft, some of the convicted were such as confessed their Guilt, the Court as I understand began their proceedings with the accusations of the afflicted and then went upon other humane evidences to strengthen that. I was almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their Majesties in the Eastern part of the County and depended upon the Judgment of the Court as to a right method of proceeding in cases of Witchcraft but when I came home I found many persons in a strange ferment of dissatisfaction which was increased by some hott Spiritts that blew up the flame, but on enquiring into the matter I found that the  Devill had taken upon him the name and shape of severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge of good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the committing of any more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity, and those that have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings against them wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be done unto the Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions or commands if their Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller ordering this perplexed affair. I have also put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or other, that may increase the needless disputes of people upon this occasion, because I saw a likelyhood of kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admitt any publique and open Contests and I have grieved to see that some who should have done their Majesties and this Province better service have so far taken Councill of Passion as to desire the precipitancy of these matters, these things have been improved by some to give me many interuptions in their Majesties service and in truth none of my vexations have been greater than this, than that their majesties service has been hereby unhappily clogged, and the Persons who have made soe ill improvement of these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon mee, but I hereby declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their Majesties Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might be exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did prevaile either to the committing or trying any of them, I did before any application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings of the Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be known. Sir I beg pardon for giving you all this trouble, the reason is because I know my enemies are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take this liberty because I depend upon your friendship, and desire you will please to give a true understanding of the matter if any thing of this kind be urged or made use of against mee.

William Phips (1692-1693)", "content": "(Letter No. 2)Boston in New England  Febry 21st, 1692/3.  May it please yor. Lordshp. By the Capn. of the Samuell and Henry I gave an account that att my arrival here I found the Prisons full of people committed upon suspition of witchcraft and that continuall complaints were made to me that many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they cryed out upon severall persons by name, as the cause of their torments. The number of these complaints increasing every day, by advice of the Lieut Govr. and the Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to try the suspected witches and at that time the generality of the people represented to me as reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of the same. The first in Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon and I depended upon the Court for a right method of proceeding in cases of witchcraft. At that time I went to command the army at the Eastern part of the Province, for the French and Indians had made an attack upon some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued there for some time but when I returned I  found people much disatisfied at the proceedings of the Court, for about Twenty persons were condemned and executed of which number some were thought by many persons to be innocent. The Court still proceeded in the same method of trying them, which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons who when they were brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches looked upon them instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous torments, but when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their flesh they immediately revived and came to themselves, upon [which] they made oath that the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw their shape or spectre come from their bodies which put them to such paines and torments: When I enquired into the matter I was enformed by the Judges that they begun with this, but had humane testimony against such as were condemned and undoubted proof of their being witches, but at length I found that the Devill did take upon him the shape of Innocent persons and some were accused of whose innocency I was well assured and many considerable persons of unblameable life and conversation were cried out upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr. notwithstanding persisted vigorously in the same method, to the great disatisfaction and disturbance of the people, untill I put an end to the Court and stopped the proceedings, which I did because I saw many innocent persons might otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to give an account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed, hoping that for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in England might give such rules and directions as have been practized in England for proceedings in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put an end to the Court there ware at least fifty persons in prison in great misery by reason of the extream cold and their poverty, most of them having only spectre evidence against them, and their mittimusses being defective, I caused some of them to be lett out upon bayle and put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe others and prevent them from perishing in prison, upon which some of them were convinced and acknowledged that their former proceedings were too violent and not grounded upon a right foundation but that if they might sit againe, they would proceed after another method, and whereas Mr. Increase Mathew and severall other Divines did give it as their Judgment that the Devill might afflict in the shape of an innocent person and that the look and touch of the suspected persons was not sufficient proofe against them, these things had not the same stress layd upon them as before, and upon  this consideration I permitted a spetiall Superior Court to be held at Salem in the County of Essex on the third day of January, the Lieut Govr. being Chief Judge. Their method of proceeding being altered, all that were brought to tryall to the number of fifety two, were cleared saving three, and I was enformed by the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the condemned were under the same circumstances or that there was the same reason to clear the three condemned as the rest according to his Judgment. The Deputy Govr. signed a Warrant for their speedy execution and also of five others who were condemned at the former Court of Oyer and terminer, but considering how the matter had been managed I sent a reprieve whereby the execucion was stopped untill their Maj. pleasure be signified and declared. The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged and filled with passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a Superior Court then held at Charles Towne, and indeed hath from the beginning hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by his warrant hath caused the estates, goods and chattles of the executed to be seized and disposed of without my knowledge or consent. The stop put to the first method of proceedings hath dissipated the blak cloud that threatened this Province with destruccion; for whereas this delusion of the Devill did spread and its dismall effects touched the lives and estates of many of their Ma'ties Subjects and the reputation of some of the principall persons here, and indeed unhappily clogged and interrupted their Ma'ties affaires which hath been a great vexation to me, I have no new complaints but peoples minds before divided and distracted by differing opinions concerning this matter are now well composed.I am Yor.

We being deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God hath brought upon this place, thought it our duty (after our earnest prayers to the God of Heaven, to give us help from our trouble) to lay before this Honourable Assembly, our present distressed estate, and to crave a redress of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of this Town, have been accused of witchcraft, by some distempered persons in these parts and upon complaint made have been apprehended and committed to prison. Now though we would not appear as Advocates for any who shall be found guilty  of so horrid a crime, but we heartily desire that this place, and the whole land, may be purged from that great wickedness: yet if any of our #[freinds] friends and neighbours have been misrepresented, as tis possible some of them have been; wee would crave leave (if it might be without offence) to speak something in their behalf, haveing no other desighn therein, then that the truth may appear. We can truly give this Testimony of the most of them belonging to this Town, that have been accused, that they never gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to their neerest relations or most intimate acquaintance, to suspect them of witchcraft. Severall of the women that are accused were members of this church in full Communion, and had obtained a good report, for their blameless conversation, and their walking as becometh woemen professing godliness. But whereas it may be alledged, that the most of our people that have been apprehended for witchcraft, have upon Examination confessed it. To which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those that freely and upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case of some of them to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the discourse some of us have had with the prisoners, we have reason to think that the extream urgency that was used with some of them by their friends and others who privately examined them, and the fear they were then under, hath been an inducement to them to own such things, as we cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of what we now declare, we judge will in time more plainly appear. And some of them have exprest to their neighbours that it hath been their great trouble, that they have wronged themselves and the truth in their confessions.We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition of severall poor familyes, on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our neighbors are like to be impoverished & ruin'd by the great charge they are at to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison, and by the fees that are demanded of them, whose case we pray may be considered. Our troubles which hitherto have been great, we foresee are like to continue and increase, if other methods be not taken then as yet have been, for there are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation & approved integrity, who are still accused, and complaints have been made against them, And we know not who can think himself safe, if the Accusations of children and others who are under a Diabolicall influence shall be received against persons of good fame. We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt among our selves, but some Honorable & worthy men of other places, do suffer in their names by the acusations of afflicted people in this Town Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our present troubles, we crave pardon for our boldness in this Address, and humbly pray this Honored Court to take into their serious consideration our low and distressed estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r counsels & Endeavors for the welfare of his people, shall be the prayer of Dated at Andov'r  18'th Oct. 1692.

Francis Dane on the Andover Outbreak -- January 1693)R'nd Sr; Whereas there have been divers reports raysed, how, and, by what hands I know not, of the Towne of Andover, and the Inhabitants, I thought it my bounden duty to give an account to others, so farr as I had the understanding of anything amongst us. Therefore doe declare, that I beleeve the reports have been Scandalous, and unjust, neither will bear the light, As for that, of the Sive, and Cisers I never heard of it, till this last Summer, and the Sabboth after I spake publiqly concerning it since which I beleeve it hath not been tryed,  As for such things of Charmes, and ways to find their cattle, I never heard, nor doe I know any Neighbour that ever did so, neither have I any grounds to beleeve it. I have lived above Fortie fower yeares in the Towne, and have been frequent among the Inhabitants, and should certainely heard if so it had been. That there was a suspicion of Goodwife Carrier among some of us before she was apprehended, I know. As for any other persons, I had no suspicion of them, and had Charity been put on, the Divel would not have had such an advantage against us, and I beleeve many Innocent persons have been accused, & Imprisoned, the Conceit of Spectre Evidence as an infallible mark did too far prevaile with us Hence we so easily parted with our neighbours of honest, & good report, & members in full Co[mbar ]union, hence we so easily parted with our Children, when we knew nothing in their lives, nor any of our neighbours to suspect them and thus things were hurried on, hence such strange breaches in families, -- severall that came before me, that spake with much sobrietie, professing their innocency, though through the Devils subtilty they were too much urged to Confesse, and we thought we did doe well in so doeing, yet they stood their ground professing they knew nothing, never saw the devil, never made a covenant with him, & the like; & some Children that we have cause to feare that dread has overcome them to accuse themselves in that they knew not.

Not long before that she was sent for she spake as to her owne particular, that she was sure she was no witch, and for her Daughter Elizabeth , she is but simplish at the best, and I feare the comon speech that was frequently spread among us, of their liberty, if they would confesse, and the like expression used by some, have brought many into a snare, the Lord direct & guide those that are in place, and give us all submissive wills, & let the Lord doe with me, & mine, what seems good in his owne eys.( Essex County Court Archives, Salem -- Witchcraft Vol. 1 Page 142 )"}, {"id": "", "slug": "n168", "title": "n168: A Bill Against Conjurations, Witchcraft, and Dealing with Evil and Wicked Spirits (December 1692)", "content": ""}, {"id": "n168.1", "slug": "n168", "title": "n168: A Bill Against Conjurations, Witchcraft, and Dealing with Evil and Wicked Spirits (December 1692)", "content": "(A Bill against Conjuration, Witchcraft and Dealing with Evil and Wicked Spirits)For more particular direction in the Execution of the Law against Witchcraft.

And, by reason of that sudden surprizal, we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated and affrighted even out of our reason. and our nearest and dearest relations, seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehended there was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then circumstanced, but by our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be, they, out of tenderness and pity, persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that confession, that it is said we made, was no other than what was suggested to us by some gentlemen, they telling us that we were witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our understandings, our reason, our faculties, almost gone, we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence, but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and most of what we said, was but, in effect, a consenting to what they said. Some time after, when we were better composed, they  telling us what we had confessed, we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his confession, and quickly after condemned and executed, some of us were told we were going after Wardwell.Mary Osgood ,Mary Tiler,Deliverance Dane ,Abigail Barker ,Sarah Wilson,Hannah Tiler.( Thomas Hutchinson , History of Massachusetts-Bay, II, 31-32 )"}, {"id": "n172.10", "slug": "n172", "title": "n172: Petitions to the General Court, with Responses (1696-1725)", "content": "(Petition of Phillip English et al.)To his Excelency the Governor and the Honorable Counsell and Generall Asembly for the Province of the Massatusetts Bay in New England Conven'd. at Boston May 25th 1709 The Humble Adress and Motion of Several of the Inhabitants of the s'd Province some of which had their near Relations Either Parents or others who suffered Death in the Dark and Dollfull times that past over this province in the Year 1692 under the suposition and in that Gloumy Day by Some (thought prov'd) of Being Guilty of witchcraft w'ch we have all the Reson in the world to hope and beleive they were Inocent off, and others of us that Either our selves or some of our Relations have Been Imprison'd impared and Blasted in our Reputations and Estates by Reson of the same. its not our Intent Neither Do we Reflect on the Judges or Jurors Concern'd in those Sorrowfull tryals whome we hope #[and beleive] Did that w'ch they thought was Right in that hour of Darkness. but that w'ch we move and pray for is that You Would Pleas to pass some sutable Acts as in Your Wisdom You may think meet and proper that shall (so far as may be) Restore the Reputations to the Posterity of the suffurers and Remunerate them as to what they have been Damnified in their Estates therby we Do not Without Remors and greif Recount these sorrowfull things But we Humbly Conceive that we are Bound in Consience and Duty to god and to our selves Relatives and posterity and Country Humbly to make this Motion praying God to Direct You in this and all Your Weighty Consultations.

Near  eight years old, brother Richard says, I shall be eight years old in  November next. Q. Who made you a witch? A. My mother, she  made me set my hand to a book. Q. How did you set your hand to  it? A. I touched it with my fingers and the book was red, the paper   of it was white. She said she never had seen the black man; the place  where she did it was in Andrew Foster's pasture and Elizabeth Johnson junr. was there. Being asked who was there beside, she answered  her Aunt Toothaker and her cousin. Being asked when it was, she  said, when she was baptized. Q. What did they promise to give you?  A. A black dog. Q. Did the dog ever come to you? A. No. Q. But  you said you saw a cat once. What did that say to you? A. It said  it would tear me in pieces if I would not set my hand to the book.  She said her mother baptized her, and the devil or black man was  not there, as she saw, and her mother said when she baptized her,  thou are mine for ever and ever and amen. Q. How did you afflict  folks? A. I pinched them, and she said she had no puppets, but  she went to them that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in  her body or her spirit, she said in her spirit. She said her mother  carried her thither to afflict. Q. How did your mother carry you  when she was in prison? A. She came like a black cat. Q. How did  you know that it was your mother? A. The cat told me so that she  was my mother. She said she afflicted Phelp's child last saturday,  and Elizabeth Johnson joined with her to do it. She had a wooden  spear, about as long as her finger, of Elizabeth Johnson, and she had  it of the devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the  witch meeting at the village.

The Prisoners were called in one by one, and as they came in  were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot  from the Justices, and the Accusers between the Justices and them;  the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before the Justices, with an   Officer appointed to hold each hand, least they should therewith  afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on the Jus-  tices; for if they look'd on the afflicted, they would either fall into  their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of  the Prisoners, who it was afflicted these Girls, etc., they were put  upon saying the Lords Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the  afflicted seem'd to be out of their Fits, they would look steadfastly  on some one person, and frequently not speak; and then the Justices  said they were struck dumb, and after a little time would speak again;  then the Justices said to the Accusers, \u201cwhich of you will go and  touch the Prisoner at the Bar?\u201d then the most couragious would ad-  venture, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall  down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up  and carried to the Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon  as they were touched by the accused, the Justices would say, they are  well, before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that  the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as  a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but no notice  taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her  and asked her name.But I having an opportunity to Discourse Mr. Hale (with whom  I had formerly acquaintance) I took his advice, what I had best to  do, and desired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak  with her that accused my Wife; which he promised should be, I  acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him.Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over,  and told me I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser,  viz . Abigail Williams , a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could  not be in private at Mr. Parris's House, as he had promised me; we  went therefore into the Alehouse, where an Indian Man attended us,  who it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder,  he shewed several Scars, that seemed as if they had been long there,  and shewed them as done by Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his  Wife, who also was a Slave, was imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now  instead of one Accuser, they all came in, who began to tumble down  like Swine, and then three Women were called in to attend them.  We in the Room were all at a stand, to see who they would cry  out of; but in a short time they cried out, Cary ; and immediately   after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before  them, who were sitting in a Chamber near by, waiting for this.Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two  Girls; my Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any knowl-  edge of them before that day; she was forced to stand with her  Arms stretched out. I did request that I might hold one of her  hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe the Tears  from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she  desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint.Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment  those persons, and she should have strength enough to stand. I  speaking something against their cruel proceedings, they commanded  me to be silent, or else I should be turned out of the Room. The  Indian before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her  Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Justices) fell  down and tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices  asked the Girls, who afflicted the Indian? they answered she ( mean-  ing my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch  him, in order to his cure, but her head must be turned another way,  least instead of curing, she should make him worse, by her looking on  him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took  hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous  manner; then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and  the cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their  Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take  vengeance on them, and desired that God would deliver us out of the  hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with  difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it;  if there had, could have taken but little rest that Night. She was  committed to Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to  remove her to Cambridge Prison, which is in our County of Middle-  sex. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor put  Irons on her legs (having received such a command) the weight of  them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions,  soon brought her into Convulsion Fits, so that I thought she would  have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken  off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved her Life,  so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem   coming on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed;  and finding that the Spectre- Evidence was there received, together  with Idle, if not malicious Stories, against Peoples Lives, I did easily  perceive which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that  served for one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her  danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she  would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal  in our own County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for  it, and were put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much, that I under-  stood thereby it was not intended, which put me upon consulting  the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of God was ef-  fected, and she got to Road Island, but soon found her self not safe  when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she  went to New-York, along with some others that had escaped their  cruel hands; where we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher ,  Esq; Governour, who was very courteous to us. After this some of  my Goods were seized in a Friends hands, with whom I had left them,  and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in Custody half a  day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners,  and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution,  no sober Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings;  which is the more, considering what a People for Religion, I mean  the profession of it, we have been; those that suffered being many of  them Church-Members, and most of them unspotted in their Con-  versation, till their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for  accusing them.Per  Nathaniel Cary.

Curwin, Esqrs. April 19, 1692.Giles Cory, you are brought before authority upon high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft; now tell us the truth in this matter.I hope through the goodness of God I shall, for that matter I never had no hand in, in my life. Which of you have seen this man hurt you? Mary Wolcott, Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam, jr. and Abi- gail Williams affirmed he had hurt themHath he hurt you too? speaking to Elizabeth Hubbard. She going to answer was prevented by a fit. Benjamin Gold, hath he hurt you? I have seen him several times, and been hurt after it, but cannot affirm that it was he. Hath he brought the book to any of you? Mary Wolcott and Abigail Williams and others affirmed he had brought the book to them.Giles Cory, they accuse you, or your appearance, of  hurting them, and bringing the book to them. What do you say? Why do you hurt them? Tell us the truth. I never did hurt them. It is your appearance hurts them, they charge you; tell us what you have done. I have done nothing to damage them.Have you ever entered into contract with the devil? I never did. What temptations have you had? I never had temptations in my life. What, have you done it without temptations?What was the reason (said goodwife Bibber) that you were frighted in the cow-house? and then the questionist was suddenly seized with a violent fit.Samuel Braybrook, goodman Bibber, and his daughter, testified that he had told them this morning that he was frighted in the cow-house. Cory denied it. This was not your appearance but your person, and you told them so this morning: why do you deny it? What did you see in the cow-house? I never saw nothing but my cattle. Divers witnessed that he told them he was frighted. Well, what do you say to these witnesses? What was it frighted you? I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my life. Tell the truth, what was it frighted you? I do not know any thing that frighted me.All the afflicted were seized now with fits, and troubled with pinches. Then the court ordered his hands to be tied. What, is it not enough to act witchcraft at other times, but must you do it now in the face of authority? I am a poor creature, and cannot help it. Upon the motion of his head again, they had their heads and necks afflicted.Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses, that heard you speak after this manner, this very morning? I never saw any thing but a black hog. You said that you were stopt once in prayer; what stopt you? I cannot tell; my wife came towards me and found fault with me for saying living to God and dying to sin.What was it frighted you in the barn? I know nothing frighted me there. Why here are three witnesses that heard you say so to-day. I do not remember it.Thomas Gold testified that he heard him say, that he knew enough against his wife, that would do her business. What was it that you knew against your wife? Why that of living to God, and dying to sin. The Marshal and Bibber's daughter confirmed the same, that he said he could say that that would do his wife's business.I have said what I can say to that. What was that about your ox? I thought he was hipt.What ointment was that your wife had when she was seized? You said it was ointment she made by major Gidney's direction. He denied it, and said she had it of goody Bibber, or from her direction. Goody Bibber said it is not like that ointment. You said you knew, upon your own knowledge, that she had it of major Gidney. He denied it.Did not you say, when you went to the ferry with your wife, you would not go over to Boston now, for you should come yourself the next week? I would not go over, because I had not money. The Marshal testified he said as before.One of his hands was let go, and several were afflicted. He held his head on one side, and then the heads of seve- ral of the afflicted were held on one side. He drew in his cheeks, and the cheeks of some of the afflicted were suckt in.John Bibber and his wife gave testimony concerning some temptations he had to make away with himself. How doth this agree with what you said, that you had no temptations? I meant temptation to witchcraft. If you can give away to self murther, that will make way to temptation to witchcraft.Note. There was witness by several, that he said he would make away with himself, and charge his death up- on his son. Goody Bibber testified that the said Cory called said Bibber's husband, damn'd, devilish rogue. Other vile expressions testified in open court by several others.Salem Village, April 19, 1692. Mr. Samuel Parris being desired to take in writing the examination of Giles Cory, delivered it in; and upon hear- ing the same, and seeing what we did see at the time of his examination, together with the charge of the afflicted persons against him, we committed him to their majesties' gaol.

And about twelve of the Clock, they went into the Meeting-House, which was Thronged with Spectators: Mr. Noyes began with a very pertinent and pathetic_?_l Prayer; and Goodwife C. being called to answer to what was Alledged against her, she desired to go to Prayer, which was much wondred at, in the presence of so many hundred people: The Magistrates told her, they would not admit it; they came not there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her, in what was Alledged against her. The Worshipful Mr. Hathorne, asked her, Why she Afflicted those Children! she said, she did not Afflict them. He asked her, who did then? she said, I do not know; How should I know? The Number of the Afflicted Persons were about that time Ten, viz. Four Married Women, Mrs Pope, Mrs. Putman, Goodw. Bibber, and an Ancient Woman, named Goodall, three Maids, Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes, at Thomas Putman\u2019s, and a Maid at Dr. Griggs\u2019s, there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age, each of them, or thereabouts, viz. Elizabeth Parris, Abigail Williams and Ann Putman; these were most of them at G. C\u2019s Examination, and did vehemently accuse her in the Assembly of afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, &c. And that they did in their Fit, see her Likeness coming to them, and bringing a Book to them, she said, she had no Book; they affirmed, she had a Yellow-Bird, that used to suck betwixt her Fingers, and being asked about it, if she had any Familiar Spirit, that attended her, she said, She had no Familiarity with any such thing- She was a Gospel Woman: which Title she called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her, ah! She was, A Gospel Witch. Ann Putman did there affirm, that one day when Lieutenant Fuller was at Prayer at her Fathers House, she saw the shape of Goodw. C. and she thought Goodw. N. Praying at the same time to the Devil, she was not sure it was Goodw. N. she thought it was; but very sure she saw the Shape of G. C. The said C. said, they were poor, distracted Children, and no heed to be given to what they said. Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes replyed, it was the judgment of all that were present, they were Bewitched, and only she the Accused Person said, they were Distracted. It was observed several times, that if she did but bite her Under lip in time of Examination the persons afflicted were bitten on their armes and wrists and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Ministers and others. And being watched for that, if she did but Pinch her Fingers, or Graspe one Hand, hard in another, they were Pinched and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, and Spectators. After that, it was observed, that if she did but lean her Breast, against the Seat, in the Meeting House, (being the Barr at which she stood,) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of grievous torment in her Bowels as if they were torn out. She vehemently accused said C. as the instrument, and first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, she got off her Shoe, and hit Goodwife C. on the head with it. After these postures were watched, if said C. did but stir her feet, they were afflicted in their Feet, and stamped fearfully. The afflicted persons asked her why she did not go to the company of Witches which were before the Meeting house mustering? Did she not hear the Drum beat? They accused her of having Familiarity with the Devil, in the time of Examination, in the shape of a Black man whispering in her ear; they affirmed, that her Yellow-Bird, sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly; and order being given to see if there were any sign, the Girl that saw it, said, it was too late now; she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head; which was found there sticking upright. They told her, she had Covenanted with the Devil for ten years, six of them were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the Magistrates to answer that Question in the Catechism, How many persons be there in the God-Head? she answered it but oddly, yet was there no great thing to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon her, and said, They could not prove a Witch; she was that Afternoon Committed to Salem-Prison; and after she was in Custody, she did not so appear to them, and afflict them as before.( Deodat Lawson.

No Sir, I say before God, before whom I stand, that  I know nothing of witchcraft. Who is this man? Ann Putman named  him. -- Mary Walcot said she had seen his shape. What do you say to  this? I never did hurt them. Who hurt you Ann Putman ? That man.  I never hurt her. Ann Putman said, he is upon the beam. Just such a  discovery of the person carried out, and she confessed; and if you  would find mercy of God, you must confess. -- If I should confess  this, I must confess what is false. Tell how far you have gone, who  hurts you? I do not know, I am absolutely free. As you say, God  knows. If you will confess the truth, we desire nothing else that you  may not hide you guilt, if you are guilty, and therefore confess if so.  I speak before God that I am clear from this accusation. What, in all  respects? Yes in all respects. Doth this man hurt you? Their mouths  were stopped. You hear several accuse you, though one cannot open  her mouth. I am altogether free. Charge him not unless it be he. This  is the man say some, and some say he is very like him. How did you  know his name? He did not tell me himself, but other witches told  me. Ann Putman said, it is the same man, and then she was taken with  a fit. Mary Walcot , is this the man? He is like him, I cannot say it is  he. Mercy Lewis said it is not the man. They all agreed, the man had  a bunch on his eyes. Ann Putman , in a fit, said, be you the man? ay,  do you say you be the man? did you put a mist before my eyes?  Then he was sent forth till several others were examined. When he was  brought in again, by reason of much people, and many in the win-  dows so that the accusers could not have a clear view of him, he was   ordered to be abroad, and the accusers to go forth to him and view  him in the light, which they did, and in the presence of the magis-  trates and many others discoursed quietly with him, one and all  acquitting him, but yet said he was like that man, but he had not the  wen they saw in his apparition, Note, he was a hilly faced man and  stood shaded by reason of his own hair, so that for a time he seemed  to some by-standers and observers, to be considerably like the person  the afflicted did describe.Mr. Samuel Parris , being desired to take in writing the examina-  tion of Nehemiah Abbot , hath delivered it as aforesaid, and upon  hearing the same did see cause to dismiss him.John Hawthorne ,  Jona.

She  said, the Man told her so.Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring  was made; and the same Accuser cried out, \u201cthere stands Aldin , a  bold fellow with his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and  Shot to the Indians and French, and lies with the Indian Squaes,  and has Indian Papooses.\u201d Then was Aldin committed to the Marshal's  Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted  them with his Sword. After some hours Aldin was sent for to the  Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required  Aldin to stand upon a Chair, to the open view of all the People.The Accusers cried out that Aldin did pinch them, then, when  he stood upon the Chair, in the sight of all the People, a good way  distant from them, one of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold  open Aldin's hands, that he might not pinch those Creatures. Aldin  asked them why they should think that he should come to that  Village to afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before?  Mr. Gidney bid Aldin confess, and give glory to God; Aldin said  he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped he should never  gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they  ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one,  that could bring in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might  give suspicion of his being such an one. Mr. Gidney said he had  known Aldin many Years, and had been at Sea with him, and al-  ways look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did see cause  to alter his judgment: Aldin answered, he was sorry for that, but  he hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall  that judgment again, and added that he hoped that he should with  Job maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid Aldin look upon  the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell down. Aldin asked  Mr. Gidney , what Reason there could be given, why Aldin's looking  upon him  did not strike him  down as well; but no reason was given  that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to Aldin to touch them,  and this touch they said made them well. Aldin began to speak of  the Providence of God in suffering these Creatures to accuse Inno-  cent persons. Mr. Noyes asked Aldin why he would offer to speak of  the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said Mr. Noyes )  governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Dis-  course, and stopt Aldin's mouth, as to that. Aldin told Mr. Gidney ,  that he could assure him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I  can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all these say of  me. But Aldin was again committed to the Marshal, and his Mittimus  written, which was as follows.( Robert Calef. More Wonders of the Invisible World, Display\u2019d in Five Parts. (London: Nath.

Dorcas Hoar )[September 6, 1692 ]John Hale aged 56 yeares Testifieth 6. 7. 1692 That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told concerning Dorcas Hoar her beeing a fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune, viz that she should live poorely so long as her husband willm Hoar did live, but the said will should dye before her, & after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of Ens: Corning & his wife who should dye.first & that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares agoe the s'd Dorcas manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life & that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry, & their were rules to know what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book & evill art shee seemed to me to renounce, or reject all such practices: whereupon I had great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I discovered  an evillractice had been between a servant of mine & some of s'd Hoars children in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd Hoars . and I had a daughter Rebecca then between 11 & 12 years old, whome I asked if she knew of the Hoars stealing: she told me yea, But durst not reveale it to me, & one reason was, she was threatened that Goody Hoar was a witch & had a book by w'ch shee could tell what s'd Rebecca did tell me in my house & if the s'd Rebecca told me of the stealing, the said Hoar would raise the devill to kill her, or bewitch her, or words to that effect. (but whether she said that Dorcas her selfe or her chilldren told Rebecca those words I remember not) I asked Rebecca if she saw the book she said yea, she was shewed that book & their were many streaks & pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said Hoar could reveale secretes & work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was, she said it was like a gramer, that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you of the stealing Goody Hoar will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of Goody Hoar . But she replyed I know Goody Hoar is a witch (or to the effect) & then told storys of strange things that had been acted in or about my house, when I & my wife were abroad to fright s'd Rebecca into silence about the theft, w'ch s'd Rebecca judged to be acts of s'd Hoars witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd Hoar had told me of a book of palmstry she had, but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better satisfyed I asked Thomas Tuck if he knew Goody Hoar to have a book of fortune telling & he said yea shee had, such a kind of book w'ch he had seen w'th streaks & pictures in it and that it was about the bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer, or book of like magnitude. this confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them w'ch can kill the boady &c.About those times other things were spoken of the s'd Hoares suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them, for his consideration & as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had & W'm Hoar answered the book was John Samsons & his wife had returned the  book long agoe & so the matter was left for that time. When discourses revived of Goody Hoars fortune telling of later times, & she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may things that I had known & heard of her. Shee told me that he owne fortune that she spake of, she was told by a shipmaster when she was first marryed. & Ens: Corning fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd Corning or his wife: But as I take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill, or any spirit but ones, & that was soon after old Thomas Tuck dyed (w'ch I take to be about ten yeare since) & that shee took it to be the Ghost of Thom: tuck coming to speak w'th her about some land s'd Tuck had told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost & got away.The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of John Samsons w'ch he had from her as she said above 20 years agoe & that shee had not told fortunes since the time I had layed before her the evill of it. w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th John Samson & he told me that he had a book of Palmstry when he lived at Goody Hoars w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. & he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since & had not seen it sinceJurat in Curia  (On reverse side of paper)  Mr. Jno.

Like a man.  Where was it?  It was at the Eastward at Casko-bay.  Where, in the house, or in the woods?  In the woods.  In the night or in the day?  In the day.  How long agoe?  About 3 or 4 years agoe.  What did he say to you?   He said he would give me fine things, if I did what he would have me.  What would he have you do?  Why, he would have me be a witch.

What would the cat have you do?  She had a book and would have me put my hand to it.  And did you?  No, I did not.  Well, tell the truth, did you at any other time?  Yes, I did, that time at the Eastward.  What other creatures did you see?  I saw things like men.  What did they say to you?  Why they said I had better put my hand to the Book.

Who are you bid to hurt?  Mercy Lewes and Ann Putman.  What did you do to them when you hurt them?  I pinch't them.  How did you pinch them, do you goe in your own person to them?  No.  Doth the Devil go for you?  Yes.  And what doth he take, your spirit with him?  No. I am as well as at other times: but the Devil has my consent, and goes and hurts them.

How did you know it?  The Devil told me.  Who was the other you saw?  I do not remember her name.  Did you go and do hurt with Sarah Good ?  No, she would have me set my hand to her book also.  What mark did you make in the Devil's book when you set your hand to it?  I made a mark.  What mark?  Have you not been at other great meetings?  No.  Did you not hear of great hurt done here in the village?  Yes.  And were you never with them?  No, I was never with them.  But you know your shape appeared and hurt the people here.  Yes.  How did you know?  The Devil told me, if I gave consent, he would do it in my shape.  How long agoe?  About a fortnight agoe.  What shape did the Devil appear in then?  Like a black man with an hat.  Do not some creatures suck your body?  No.  Where do they come, to what parts, when they come to your body?  They do not come to my body, they come only in sight.  Do they speak to you?  Yes.  How do they speak to you?  As other folks.  What do they speak to you, as other folks?  Yes, almost.

The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my own Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on in my Sins, but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in any longer, but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the Magistrates, who would not believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon I shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me beg your Prayers to the Lord on my behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy meeting in Heaven.

The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least measure, how or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else they would not fall down at me; they told me, if I would not confess, I should be put down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart, to save my life; made me make the like confession I did, which confession, may it please the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night after I had made confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling such horrid lies. I was, may it please the honoured court, sworn to my confession, as I understand since, but then, at that time, was ignorant of it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord, I hope, in whom I trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive me my false forswearing myself. What I said, was altogether false against my grandfather, and Mr. Burroughs , which I did to save my life and to have my liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror, that I could not contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did though I saw nothing but death before  me, chusing rather death with a quiet conscience, than to live in such horror, which I could not suffer. Where, upon my denying my confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed more felicity in spirit, a thousand times, than I did before in my enlargement.And now, may it please your honours, your declarant, having, in part, given your honours a description of my condition, do leave it to your honours pious and judicious discretions, to take pity and compassion on my young and tender years, to act and do with me, as the Lord above and your honours shall see good, having no friend, but the Lord, to plead my cause for me; not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft, nor any other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant shall for ever pray, as she is bound in duty, for your honours happiness in this life and eternal felicity in the world to come.

Before Major Gedney, Mr. Hathorne, Mr. Corwin and Capt. Higginson.Goody Foster, you remember we have three times spoken with you, and do you now remember what you then confessed to us? Her former confession was read, which she owned to be all true.You have been engaged in very great wickedness, and some have been left to hardness of heart to deny; but it seems that God will give you more favor than others, inasmuch as you relent. But your daughter here hath confessed some things that you did not tell us of. Your daughter was with you and Goody Carrier, when you did ride upon the stick. A. I did not know it. Q. How long have you known your daughter to be engaged? A. I cannot tell, nor have I any knowledge of it at all. Q. Did you see your daughter at the meeting? A. No. Q. Did not you know your daughter to be a witch? A. No. Q. Your daughter said she was at the witches meeting, and that you yourself stood at a distance off and did not partake at that meeting; and you yourself said so also; give us a relation from the beginning until now. A. I know none of their names that were there, but only Goody Carrier. Q. Would you know their frees if you saw them? A. I (400) cannot tell. Q. Were there not two companies in the field at the same time? A. I remember no more.Mary Warren, one of the afflicted, said that Goody Carrier\u2019s shape told her, that this Goody Foster had made her daughter a witch. Q. Do not you acknowledge that you did so about thirteen years ago? A. No, and I know no more of my daughter\u2019s being a witch than what day I shall die upon. Q. Are you willing your daughter should make a full and free confession? A. Yes. Q. Are you willing to do so too? A. Yes. Q. You cannot expect peace of conscience without a free confession. A. If I knew any thing more, I would speak it to the utmost. Goody Lacey, the daughter, called in, began thus; Oh, mother! how do you do? We have left Christ, and the Devil hath gat hold of us. How shall I get rid of this evil one? I desire God to break my rocky heart that I may get the victory this time. Q. Goody Foster, you cannot get rid of this snare, your heart and mouth is not open. A. I did not see the Devil, I was praying to the Lord. Q. What Lord? A. To God. Q. What God do witches pray to? A. I cannot tell, the Lord help me. Q. Goody Lacey, had you no discourse with your mother in your riding? A. No, I think I had not a word. Q. Who rid foremost on that stick to the village? A. I suppose my mother. Goody Foster said that Goody Carrier was foremost. Q. Goody Lacey, how many years ago since they were baptized? A. Three or four years ago, I suppose. Q. Who baptized them? A. The old serpent. Q. How did he do it? A. He dipped their heads in the water, saying they were his, and that he had power over them. Q. Where was this? A. At Fall\u2019s river. Q. How many were baptized that day? A. Some of the chief; I think there were six baptized. Q. Name them. A. I think they were of the higher powers. These were then removed.Mary Lacey, the grand-daughter, was brought in, and Mary Warren in a violent fit. Q. How dare you come in here, and bring the Devil with you, to afflict these poor creatures? A. I know nothing of it. Lacey laying her hand on Warren\u2019s arm; she recovered from her fit. Q. You are here accused for practising witchcraft upon Goody Ballard ; which way do you do it? A. I cannot tell. Where is my mother that made me a witch, and I knew it not? Q. Can you look upon that maid, Mary Warren, and not hurt her? Look upon her in a friendly way. She trying so to do, struck her down with her eyes. Q. Do you acknowledge now you are a witch? A. Yes. Q. How long have you been a witch? A. Not above a week. Q. Did the Devil appear to you? A. Yes. Q. In what shape? A. In the shape of a horse. Q. What did he say to you? A. He bid me not to be afraid of any tiring, and he would not bring me out; but he has proved a liar from the beginning. Q. When was this? A. I know not; above a week. Q. Did you set your hand to the book? A. No. Q. Did he bid you worship him? A. Yes; he bid me also afflict persons. You are now in the way to obtain mercy if you will confess and repent. She said, The Lord help me. Q. Do not you desire to be saved by Christ? A. Yes. Then you must confess freely what you know in this matter. She then proceeded. I was in bed, and the Devil came to me, and bid me obey him and I should want for nothing, and he would not bring me out. Q. But how long ago? A. A little more than a year. Q. Was that the first time? A. Yes. Q. How long was you gone from your father, when you run away? A. Two days. Q. Where had you your food? A. At John Stone\u2019s. Q. Did the Devil appear to you then, when you was abroad? A. No, but he put such thoughts in my mind as not to obey my parents. Q. Who did the (401) Devil bid you afflict? A. Timothy Swan. Richard Carrier comes often a-nights and has me to afflict persons. Q. Where do ye go? A. To Goody Ballard\u2019s sometimes. Q. How many of you were there at a time? A. Richard Carrier and his mother, and my mother and grandmother. Upon reading over the confession so far, Goody Lacey, the mother, owned this last particular. Q. How many more witches are there in Andover? A. I know no more, but Richard Carrier.Tell all the truth. A. I cannot yet. Q. Did you use at any time to ride upon a stick or pole? A. Yes. Q. How high? A. Sometimes above the trees. Q. Your mother struck down these afflicted persons, and she confessed so far, till at last she could shake hands with them freely and do them no hurt. Be you also free and tell the truth. What sort of worship did you do the Devil? A. He bid me pray to him and serve him and said he was a god and lord to me. Q. What meetings have you been at, at the village? A. I was once there and Richard Carrier rode with me on a pole, and the Devil carried us. Q. Did not some speak to you to afflict the people there? A. Yes, the Devil. Q. Was there not a man also among you there? A. None but the Devil. Q. What shape was the Devil in then? A. He was a black man, and had a high crowned hat. Q. Your mother and your grandmother say there was a minister there. How many men did you see there? A. I saw none but Richard Carrier. Q. Did you see none else? A.

Thomas Putman\u2019s Wife, Abigail Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she appeared to them, and afflicted them in their fitts: but some of the other said, that they had seen her, but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which was Mary Walcut, who was presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out of her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her wrist. It was so disposed, that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of Examination, but both Magistrates and Ministers, told me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences made by her, were much after the same manner, as the former was. And her motions did produce like effects as to Biteing, Pinching, Bruising Tormenting, at their Breasts, by her Leaning, and when, bended Back, were as if their Backs was broken. The afflicted persons said, the Black Man, whispered to her in the Assembly, and therefore she could not hear what the Magistrates said unto her. They said also that she did then ride by the Meeting-house, behind the Black Man. Thomas Putman\u2019s wife, had a grievous Fit, in the time of Examination, to the very great Impairing of her strength, and wasting of her spirits, insomuch as she could hardly, move hand, or foot, when she was carryed out. Others also were there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such an hideous scrietch and noise, (which I heard as I walked, at a little distance from the Meeting house,) as did amaze me, and some that were within, told me the whole assembly was struck with consternation, and they were afraid, that those that sate next to them, were under the influence of Witchcraft.

When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which the Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply to Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter , who had been faulty in setting their hands to the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were \u201cWhat, do these persons give in Evidence against me now, they used to come among us.\u201d After the honoured Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the  Verdict, several of the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon the honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I could not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and then going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar, but made no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a principal Evidence against her.Thomas Fisk.

Sept. 92.)  of Mary Osgood , wife of Captain Osgood of Andover, taken before John Hawthorne and other their Majesties justices.She confesses, that about 11 years ago, when she was in a melancholy state and condition, she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain time, she saw the appearance of a cat, at the end of the house, which yet she thought was a real cat. However, at that time, it diverted her from praying to God, and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which time she made a covenant with the devil, who, as a black man, came to her and presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger and that left a red spot: And that upon her signing, the devil told her he was her God, and that she should serve and worship him, and, she believes, she consented to it. She says further, that about two years agone, she was carried through the air, in company with deacon Frye's wife , Ebenezer Baker's wife , and Goody Tyler , to five mile pond, where she was baptized by the devil, who dipped her face in the water and made her renounce her former baptism, and told her she must be his, soul and body, forever, and that she must serve him, which she promised to do. She says, the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping, and that she was transported back again through the air, in company with the forenamed persons, in the same manner as she went, and believes they were carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As I said before, viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above. -- She confesses she has afflicted three persons, John Sawdy , Martha Sprague and Rose Foster , and that she did it by pinching her bed clothes, and giving consent the devil should do it in her shape, and that the devil could not do it without her consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court, by the glance of her eye. She says, as she was coming down to Salem to be  examined, she and the rest of the company with her, stopped at Mr. Phillips's to refresh themselves, and the afflicted persons, being behind them upon the road, came up just as she was mounting again and were then afflicted, and cried out upon her, so that she was forced to stay until they were all past, and said she only looked that way towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of witchcraft? A. Satan, and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and quietness in her future state, but never performed any thing; and that she has lived more miserably and more discontented since, than ever before. She confesses further, that she herself, in company with Goody Parker , Goody Tyler , and Goody Dean , had a meeting at Moses Tyler's house, last monday night, to afflict, and that she and Goody Dean carried the shape of Mr. Dean, the minister, between them, to make persons believe that Mr. Dean afflicted. Q. What hindered you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so to be, that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof, as I shall answer in the presence of God and his people; but said, that the black man stood before her, and told her, that what she had confessed was a lie; notwithstanding, she said that what she had confessed was true, and thereto put her hand. Her husband being present was asked, if he judged his wife to be any way discomposed. He answered, that having lived with her so long, he doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed, but has cause to believe what she has said is true. -- When Mistress Osgood was first called, she afflicted Martha Sprague and Rose Foster , by the glance of her eyes, and recovered them out of their fits by the touch of her hand. Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson and Hannah Post saw Mistress Osgood afflicting Sprague and Foster . -- The said Hannah Post and Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson, jun. and Rose Foster and Mary Richardson were afflicted by Mistress Osgood , in the time of their examination, and recovered by her touching of their hands.I underwritten, being appointed by authority, to take this examination, do testify upon oath, taken in court, that this is a true copy of the substance of it, to the best of my knowledge,  5 Jan1692 -- 3.

Being asked, why she prefixed a time and spake of her being baptised, &c.: about twelve years since; she replyed, and said, that when she had owned the thing, they asked the time; to which she answered, that she knew not the time; but being told that she did know the time and must tell the time, and the like; she considered that about twelve years before (when she had her last child) she had a fitt of sicknesse, and was melancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any, and accordingly did prefix the said time.Being asked about the cat, in the shape of which she had confessed the devill appeared to her, &c. she replyed, that being told that the devill had appeared to her, and must needs appear to her, &c.; (she being a witch) she at length did own that the devill had appeared to her; and being press\u2019d to say in what creature\u2019s shape he appeared in, she at length did say, that it was in the shape of a cat; remembering that some time before her being apprehended, as she went out at her door, she saw a cat, &c.: not as though she any whitt suspected the said cat to be the devill in the day of *** but because some creature she must mention, and this came thus into her mind at that time.( Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston, MA., 2nd ser., vol. 3 (Boston: John Eliot, 1815), pp. 222. )"}, {"id": "n96.3", "slug": "n96", "title": "n096: Mary Osgood", "content": "(Petition for Mary Osgood , Eunice Fry , Deliverance Dane , Sarah Wilson, Sr. , and Abigail Barker )[++ (January 3, 1693) ]To the honoured court of Assize held at Salem, The humble address of several of the inhabitants of Andover. May it please this honoured court, We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long under in prison, and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that great transgression which hath been laid to their charge, have thought it our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to speak something at present are Mrs. Mary Osgood , Eunice Frye , Deliverance Dane , Sarah Wilson and Abigail Barker , who are women of whom we can truly give this character and commendation, that they have not only lived among us so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to suspect them of witchcraft, but by their sober godly and exemplary conversation have obtained a good report in the place, where they have been well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members.We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were accused of so horrid a crime, not considering, then, that the most innocent were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood, their relations and others, tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have thought any evil of them, yet, through a misrepresentation of the truth of that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people, took great pains to persuade them to own what they were, by the afflicted, charged with, and, indeed, did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves guilty, as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good women did very much assert their innocency, yet some of them said they were not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them, because there was that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain indication and discovery of witchcraft, yet they seriously professed they knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless, by the unwearied sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both  at home and at Salem, they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they were charged with, and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and believe they are clear of. And, it is probable, the fear of what the event might be, and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them, that confessing was the only way to obtain favour, might be too powerful a temptation for timorous women to withstand, in the hurry and distraction that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves proceeded from conviction of the fact, we should have had nothing to have said for them, but we are induced to think that it did not, because they did soon privately retract what they had said, as we are informed, and, while they were in prison, they declared to such as they had confidence to speak freely and plainly to, that they were not guilty of what they had owned, and that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden they laboured under: Now, though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of, yet, considering the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us, and what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame, we cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours, who are under the like circumstances with these that have been named, we can truly say of them that while they lived among us, we have had no cause to judge them such persons as, of late, they have been represented and reported to be, nor do we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of that evil that they are now charged with.Dudley BradstreetFrancis Dane, sen.Thomas BarnardTho.

The said officer required us in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate, pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which, he seised upon our cattell, Corn & hay, to a considerable value; and ordered us to go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife, otherwise the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law might give him against us, and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by the loss of our Estate, went to the sherriff accordingly, who told us he might take away all that was seised. if he pleased, but was willing to do us a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded ten pounds of us, but at length was willing to take Six pounds, which he has  obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our Mother had left any Estate, we know not of any Law in force in this Province, by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less can we understand that there is any Justice or reason, for the sherriff to seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay him a Summ of money, yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the officers great pretences of Law for what he did, partly to prevent the loss of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold.How we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case, and if it be judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us, upon the forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that obligation, which the sherriff, taking advantage of our ignorance hath brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray &c -- Dated at Andov'r  7'th Novemb'r 1692  John Parker Joseph Parker ( Mass.
